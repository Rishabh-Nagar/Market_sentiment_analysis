1.0,False,"11 18, 2015",A2ZBZ74VIW6SDJ,B00W8FYF56,Aaron B.,". . . The ability to destroy a franchise is insignificant next to the power of the PS4.

As a real Star Wars geek and Battlefront II (PS2) veteran, I echo the critics sentiments: EA falls short again.  This game is nothing but online battles with/against vulgar 12-year-olds and ber elitists who take the game way too seriously.  There is no single-player story or campaign mode.  There are no real space battlesthey took the star out of Star Wars.  Its nothing but a lackluster first-person shooter (or a rail shooter for the speeder bikes, which actually aren't too bad).

Sound:
The music doesnt particularly stand out (nor should it), but they did a great job of recording Star Wars music.  I have (and am familiar with) all the film soundtracks, and I appreciate the verisimilitude.  The voice acting is terrible, however.  Princess Leia sounds nothing like the films.  Nor does Vader.  There are so many great Darth Vader voice synthesizers out there, but they couldn't bother.  Just about anybody can do a better Darth Vader impression than whomever they cast.  Admiral Ackbar doesnt sound too bad though.

Graphics:
The graphics are picturesque, which is a pity because this is a video game and not a picture.  As aesthetic as they may be, theres a limited range pop-up, which makes shooting flying vehicles from the ground improbable.  The waypoint markers block your view and are often off-target.  But they did a really good job of making beautiful, screen-accurate locales.

Controls:
The controls are nice and responsive, but the default control scheme is limited and backwards.  Youd expect a version (or at least a variant) of the Star Wars Battlefront II controls, but nope.  They have a few setting to swap buttons, but there aren't many options.  Theres no ability to roll the X-wing, which is integral to any flight simulator.  Its basically a flying snowmobile that gets stuck upside-down a lot.  The Jedi are the same as in Battlefront II, only the Jedi are slower and need to recharge for ten seconds after using the Force, because, you know, that makes sense.

Fun Factor:
This game is an online FPS and nothing more.  Anything the game offers is better found in Call of Duty or Battlefield, whichever camp you find yourself in.  You can try to play it sheerly for the Star Wars brand, but the game will ruin itself for you quickly.  What an incredible disappointment.  We were all hoping for an updated/rebooted Battlefront II after ten years, but EA admitted that a real (non-cloned) game isn't worth its time.  EA earned Consumerists Worst Company in America award (beating tardy airlines and shifty banks) twice for this reason.","""Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. . . .

I agree with the other reviews  - this game has some serious flaws which affect playability and general fun!
First Wii Cheer had a great idea in allowing you to use one remote in each hand to execute the moves - this game, in contrast,  has you use the remote in one hand and nunchuck in the other. This idea might work if you are a child...a little child, but as the cord between the two is not that long, the moves are either restricted or impossible to perform for an adult or even a child above 8/9!!
Second is the annoying delay - some of the moves you do are recognized too late if at all, the  other times it identifies moves made, that have not actually been performed!! Add to this the need to calibrate the board between each dance set which adds a delay between play  -very fustrating!!

The graphics, while dated, are fine to me.  The problems are, firstly, the controls.  Never once do I feel like I have control over my player.  I keep hitting X to kick the make my board move.  Nothing.  Then, I do tricks.  So, things go fine at first.  Then, you will think you are even for a landing and fall.  The falling is hilarious.  It is like a rag doll being thrown.

Then, the people skating around are annoying.  I got hit a few times as well as hitting others.  You just skate around, with awful controls.

The missions.  Well, there seem to be none.  You see little icons.  You go to one and it has things you can do.  I thought it would be fun.  It is not.  The controls make it so hard to do.

There is not talking in the game.  I have played for, maybe 30 minutes and there is nobody saying anything.

I had been so excited for this game.  There is nothing fun about this at all.  No action.  No dialog.  No controls or so it feels.  It feels like an early demo.  How in the HELL this thing can cost $59 is beyond me.  $5.99 is what I would think it is worth.  For those who made the game, I wanted to like it.  The fact that you didn't give any early copies out for review should tell everyone something.

One of the worst, more boring games I have played.  I am sending this back for a refund.  I listed it as defective.  I did so because I cannot control anything.  The physics are all screwy and it is not worth anything.  It seems very obvious that the team that made this, put very little time and money into.

I want a game that you start and you are given tasks to do.  Let other skaters give you them.

I'm very computer proficient and play a TON of computer games, so troubleshooting is not something that really phases me.  Let me just say that I have NEVER had the experience of 1) not being able to get a game to run or 2) having as many problems with tech support as I did with aspyr.

Here's my experience...

--I've loaded the game on 4 different computers with no success (one of them a brand new Alienware computer).

--I've even tried completely re-installing windows XP, and still the game would not run on a ""clean"" system.

--Initially tech support said they couldn't help me and pawned me off to their licensing company...who said that they don't do tech support and said I needed to talk with Aspyr.

--Aspyr said that I should just patch the product and it would work fine.  When I said I already did that (under multiple tries), they said to try it again.... *Sigh*

--I've read on some boards that XP service pack 2 can mess up the game.  I suggested that to support but they flat out denied it.  I then installed XP (with SP2) onto a formatted computer...and again the game would not run.

1.0,False,"11 11, 2014",AGPM6OHI7R3M4,B00J48C36S,Joshua Miller,"Bottom line, not only does AC Unity not advance the series forward, it makes a few totally unacceptable choices that should have never been added. Assassins Creed Unity is by no means a revolutionary step for the game, rather just the 2014 iteration of this annual title. I got Assassin's Creed Unity in my bundled XBOX One purchase, so basically I got it for free with the console, which you can't beat price-wise. I'm not quite sure how this is any different than AC 1, 2, or 3. Sure the graphics are better, the geography is different, and some game mechanics have been improved, but virtually you are just doing the same thing over and over just as in most AC games. In my personal opinion, Unity takes a several steps backward from AC Black Flag. Every AC game can't have ships, I get it, but that was such a great new feature to lose it hurts and feels like something needs to step into the breech, which nothing does. Unity is a return to the pre-Black Flag games. You're in a major historical city assassinating people. The color scale is back to a more bleak look, with pales and greys versus the blues and greens of AC Black Flag. Other than the sheer grandeur of the city, AC Unity lacks that big ""wow"" factor to really make it something special that changes the franchise. As a big fan of the franchise, I can't say this game stands out amongst the rest, rather is just the next game in long series of titles.

POSITIVES
+ Controlled Descent: Being able to actual move downward at a fast pace is refreshing when the previous options were going down slowly or just jumping off to your death.

NEGATIVES
- Micropays: This is by far and away the most deadly sin this game has committed. Want to open a certain chest? Sorry, you need to download an app for that. Want to get some loot? Sorry, you need to register with Ubisoft. Want more cool features? Sorry, you'll have to give us more money. For heaven sakes, I just bought this game and you already want more; this is beyond unacceptable.
- Loading Screens: When I heard about ACU on next gen systems, all I heard was about that their was no loading screens; well whoever said that must have been delusional. I've had non-stop loading screens since I started playing. If anything the game is moving slower than any other AC game I've played.
- Boring Story: Their is just no ""wow"" moment to be had. It reads like something so manufactured because they needed an idea to get out a game in Fall 2014, not because it was actually something smart.
- Doesn't capitalize on being a 'franchise': One of the great things about being almost 10 games deep into a franchise is that they can build on one another. AC II built on the original to not make it as repetitive. Brotherhood brought in other assassins, and Black Flag added ships as a major element. All of these things advance the game, but Unity goes in the opposite direction.
- Big doesn't equal better: They've touted this as the biggest game they've ever done yada yada yada. Yes, the land mass is big, but it is also boring and blends together. Nothing about this land gets me excited. In Black Flag you had to travel to each island and explore where here you are just moving through a bigger land to collect the same useless collectables as always.","One Step Forward, Five Steps Back",1415664000,23,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The feel of the character during movement and shooting is inexcusably remedial, very slow, very tedious to aim, and like others said it takes far to much effort to drop 1 guy.

The game reminds me of a poor man's Red Faction 2 for XBOX with noticeably better graphics, but as far as 360 goes, the other 6 games I currently own surpass PDZ in the graphics department.

So the reason for my title is that for those who game this game 5 stars...where exactly are you standards?  I can think of at least a dozen shooters off the top of my head for the regular XBOX that I'd rather be playing than PDZ, and Doom 3 in my opinion has better grahpics than this game.  Halo, Halo 2, Doom 3, Project Snowblind, Mace Griffin...the list goes on and on, and obviously Quake 4 and COD 2 for the 360 trump this game.

Do yourself a favor, even if you love spy-type storylines and you're in need of a shooter, rent it first and you'll see what I mean.  It's maybe worth 10 bucks when the price comes down, but definitely not worth 40-50, and most definitely not a launch console seller.

There is enough of power leveling and other things in an rpg and I'm wondering why the overly complicated and confusing customization of equipment, weapons, etc. (so I just gave up and just decided to buy my weapons and equipment); also if a party member is not there only two can participate in battle (and I wondered if this was for the whole game) and I discovered this was many time in the game; plus there are some glitches (like selling an item and can never ever get into the dungeon where needed to open a door and could not get beyond that point and starting the game over).

On another note, which I discovered later and never even thought about because I always thought standard rpgs had HP, MP, etc. and then I discover SC and only a 100 points but in battle there is no indication of how much you are using, whether you run out and I was flabbergasted and just wondered who made this mess up.  I WANT A STANDARD RPG AND DO NOT WANT TO GUESS WHETHER I'M ABOUT TO DIE IN BATTLE WHICH I DID MANY TIMES AND THOUGH I WAS AT HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE BOSS IN QUESTION AND THIS JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE AND FRUSTRATED AND HAD TO TRY OVER AND JUST GOT MAD AT THE DEVELOPERS ON THIS GAME.  This happened a couple of times where I was many levels above a boss and hard as heck defeating them (on the side quests).

And even in battle a majority of the time Rose and party just died and fought battles myself and not bothered (I do not like a divided party like this).  The battle system in Tales of Graces much better and at least I knew where I stood in battle and had a full party and I could use the items normally, and in this game, which many times failed and also using mystic arts failed miserly.

And getting through the many areas and dungeons have been just pure nonsense on the camera angles that get you all turned around and then finding which way to go and also fighting any enemies while doing this is even worse and all I can say is that some of the dungeons (especially the trial ones were very generic and all seemed similar) and why so few treasures in the very long dungeons.

If they make any other games like this I'm not buying any more if they cannot make an rpg where there is normal HP and MP without getting them elsewhere (like in this game from fighting all the major hellions in the game just to get your HP up and levels meant nothing).

1.0,False,"04 6, 2009",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00005V9Q1,Aiex Halo,"So I mark Warcraft III as the point where the franchise stopped being WARcraft, and became MAGEcraft, or Magiccraft, or some stupid snippy pun regarding a favor towards magic rather than war.

And don't worry, this negative review isn't all just about the visceral hatred of high fantasy involving lots of magic.  The game itself has plenty of bad flaws.

I used to love Warcraft. But I hate Warcraft since they made it ""Blizzard presents: Magic: The Gathering"".

My favorite thing about Warcraft was exactly what they took out in III and World of: a sense of grittiness and uniqueness in a world of fantasy. There were no ""Thyalawynd"" or ""Darkheart""s or ""Ebonheart""s or ""Gyilwind""s magic fantasy crap with gravity-defying robes and swords made of silver and no shields or any semblence of tactics or strategy or even blood.

There was no ""We ah the Knoights of Lothar the Guilywind, son of Gunther the Loinhearted, son of Baxter the Baxton, son of Aragorn of Aragorn, and we foight fo peeeeeace"" versus ""Graarrgh we are demon spawns from hell who want to crush the world and kill everything that moves"".

Warcraft wasn't like that at all---Warcraft had the Orcs coming into Azeroth because their own world was destroyed by civil war, and rather than accomodate, the Humans responded with war. And it blew up in their faces as the Orcs destroyed Stormwind Keep and forced the humans into Lothleroin, with the Orcs following. I don't remember what happened after that, but I think eventually the Orcs were beaten back by the Alliance of Humans and Elves.

Then I completely do not remember a single thing about Warcraft III other than Taurens supporting the Orcs for absolutely no reason, and the Undead randomly appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and Night Elves appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and lots of pixie dust sprinkle winds magic and demons and wizards and keys and powerups and upgrades and magical fire pansy moves of doom for make benefit glorious magician of kingdom of Godwynn EverNeverwind P. Dark-Ebonheart.

Warcraft and Warcraft II were to me, the modern Medieval-fantasy equivalent of Conan the Barbarian, in that yes, magic was there, and magic was used, but only the magicians practiced magic, and the magicians could not stand up to an army of a billion Orc Grunts and Troll Axethrowers.  Sure, then there came Ogre-Mages, Death Knights, Paladins, and the like, but even those were but a small asset in an army made to fight with steel and wood and flesh, not just magic.

Instead in Warcraft III, and extending into World of Warcraft, magic becomes the centerpoint of virtually any army.  You can still use the backbone of infantry and cavalry and the like, but their effectiveness against magical heroes and magical elves and pixies is reduced by the sudden jump in population everything costs and the stupid upkeep.

But while magic would become the more central point beyond Warcraft III, War3's focus instead came upon HEROES!

The entire RTS aspect of this game is not fully broken, but rather fractured by not just the inclusion, but the heavy reliance upon individual heroes, who have dozens of hero-only chests to pick up for upgrades and equipment that can make them MORE powerful, and they have the ability to LEVEL UP and research MORE abilities and powers.

At least half the missions in the campaign I was apart of either involved playing ONLY as heroes, or playing in such a mission that only heroes could determine the outcome of battles.

Then, UPKEEP.

The idea of upkeep in this game is in no way relevant to how upkeep really works in games like Total War or in real life.  Upkeep is the cost of maintaining an army.  Upkeep does not exist in traditional RTS games.

In this game, upkeep means ""you no longer mine as many resources"" when you have too many units.  And ""too many"" ranges from 50-75 population points taken up.

And then comes the fact that full-army battles are rendered impossible when the average Orc Grunt starts costing THREE population points, and the maximum population is no longer the Blizzard standard of 200, but somewhere near 125-175 or so.

Controlling the first level of upkeep means your peasants now gather 7 of a resource rather than ten.  Medium upkeep reduces it to 5.  High upkeep reduces it to 3.  And an army under high upkeep can consist of a handful of heavy units not fit to take out a militia force twice their size.

This is only balanced by the fact that it affects all player on a map.  But another problem involving this is that because the basic units take up so much population and are so ineffective, the player is basically forced into an arm's race with their opponents, to build up their base technologies, upgrade all they can, then build the most powerful units available while ignoring the 90% of other units available to train, just to meet an evenly matched opponent who has done the same thing.

And then again, the RTS idea is fractured and shattered by the powerful emphasis on building superunits and superweapons as quickly as possible, and to hell with all other available units.

This is not how a good RTS works.  Starcraft comes to mind: an army of 30 basic Terran Marines can slaughter an enemy army of Hydralisks or Ultralisks.  An army of 30 Battlecruisers seems unstoppable, and yet can easily be torn asunder by a few Corsairs or Valkyries, or a flood of Scourges.  Or they can be broken up from all-out attack from an Arbiter's stasis, or a Ghost's lockdown.  They can suffer huge splash damage from Psionic Storms from High Templar or Infested Kerrigan.

In short, in Starcraft, every unit is effective if utilized properly.  You can win one game by playing a megalomaniac and massing dozens of super units, and win another game in the same amount of time with a ragtag militia and some special tricks of infiltration and the like.

Warcraft III has none of it.  Every unit that is not a superunit or a hero is simply cannon fodder and/or base defense until that superunit or hero is available for building.

And so what was once ""WARcraft"" and I so deridingly called ""Magecraft"" could more accurately be called ""Herocraft"", because heroes are so ridiculously overpowered that they become the center point of every game, EVEN the skirmishes, as you cannot start unless you pick a hero for your side.  AND you can get MORE THAN ONE hero on a map, one for heavy combat, one for support, and one for magic.",Where it stopped being Warcraft,1238976000,6,,

1.0,False,"08 4, 2010",A295GMS743T019,B000ZKA0J6,Lavado Townsend,"First off, this review is based on my experiences with many RTS games, my favorites being Kingdom Under Fire: Heroes, Warcraft III, Company of Heros, Command and Conquer (many of the titles), and many more. I'd like to start by saying that I put strong emphasis on STRATEGY and how well you are able to employ real life battlefield tactics. Also, I don't do single player a lot, but I do like it in this game, it is pretty good but this review is multiplayer only. With that said, I will start serving the meat and potatoes.

This is my first time ever playing a Starcraft game, so I was a bit nervous initially, dispute being an impatient and fast learner I was blown away at how well the tutorial was crafted. It was simple enough for a 10 year old, but it touched on key points and forced you to focus oh the lesson at hand. I felt like I was in school again, except with race horse blinders on this time. It was quick and to the point at the same time. After I completed it, I was confident in my Knowledge and decided to jump online to hone in my skills. Once online they had this kinda pre-ranked pool of players that all elected to practice against real people until they were ready for rated play. This helped me to test my skills even further. There wasn't much rushing, as there were too many choke points for it to be viable, but you got it occasionally. This pre-ranked pool helped me to hone my skills but ultimately set me up for failure in ranked.

When you fire move into ranked, you have to play 5 games to decide where you should be placed among the other ranked players. These games were not too difficult and I ended up winning 3 of my 5. FINALLY! Some ranked play!! Before you read the rest of this review, I'd like to say that I have over 60 matches played, each taking from 15min to an hour. After my first few games I noticed a trend, no choke points = get rushed punk! This became quickly annoying, so I eventually got to the point where I learned to rush as effectively or at least to properly defend while I tech. Out of about 15 games I had only won about 5, but I was learning fast. Around game 25 my games were getting better, I'd perfected about two strategies but as games went on I noticed that my weakness was not being more versatile. THIS IS WHERE THINGS GOT GOOD, and by good, I mean drop dead hilarious. As I tried many different strategies I noticed something... all of them had an equal chance of being countered, kudos on the balance, this was a plus, as nothing was the best, but some were less expected.

Your success depended on what your opponent was doing while you were putting your plan into action. Scouting seems like a big part of the game, but not much for finding out what to do in response to or opponent, but instead as a way to find other bases (if any) that your opponent set up. With that said, If I build a bunch of planes that could only attack ground in order to support my land units that could attack ground and air, If in fact my opponent had the perfect counter, It would probably be too late to do something about it once I found out.

This brings me my next point. There aren't really any tactics that you can use in this game, all of the units can span any map in seconds, ALL maps are as open as McDonald's @ 2:30 once all the drunk people realize how hungry they are, and aside from other mining spots, there really isn't much in the map. It felt like I was fighting in some wide open crater left by a sad and very symmetric meteor.

All in All, compared to many of my other favorite RTS games, this game feels like the inbreed child of rock, paper, scissors, and tic-tac-toe. You mass units, meet somewhere for a battle, and if the units you decided to mass are better than mine, well good game, and vice versa. ""YOU PICKED ROCK AND I PICKED PAPER, GG!"" That's the online experience in a nutshell, with as many tactics to employ as you can get out of Xs and Os on a 9 square field.

I don't believe this game took 12 years to make, I believe they made all 3, and want to release them at different times, so that you pay 120 bucks for a game that isn't even worth 50.

It was an amazing game, and one I am filled with nostalgia for. So it should come as little surprise when I say that this game does not live up to its predecessor.

But, that said, this game is, quite simply, an idiotic failure. Another anecdotal bit of context for you. I HATE using consumables in games. I finish JRPGs with 99 or 999 of everything, depending on what the cap is. I will restart a fight twelve times rather than use a health potion because ""Well, I might need it later!""

So this game was never going to be quite up my alley. Everything you do is a consumable. Your attacks are stickers. Use them; they're gone. Then you need to buy more. granted, the game is paced well enough this never seems to be a problem, at least for the eight hours I played. But the stress alone, of having to estimate how many stickers to buy to get through a level, of baaarely making it through relying on weak attacks - and of not wanting to waste money on strong stickers while shopping - is simply an astoundingly bad design choice.

Let's talk about that. Game design should incentivize fun. This game gives you incentive to only buy boring attacks, and rely on the same three things forever. Because to do otherwise would be somewhat wasteful, and it's not like it ever clearly explains how to correctly use each attack to get the most for your money. So it took me hours to learn I wasn't messing up one special attack and, underwhelmingly,  that was just all it did.

As well, the charm and humor just isn't as present. But really it's the mechanics that kill this game.

If, like me, you have found yourself in possession of a 3DS and you want to relive grand Paper Mario memories, do not give in to temptation. dig out your old N64 or Gamecube - heck, buy another - and play the real dang thing.

1.0,False,"07 12, 2008",A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B00113NYIA,A. Griffiths,"Oh dear...this is the lowest score I have given to a PS2 game for a long time. Alone In The Dark on the PS2 fails really glaringly in many ways, and provides a thoroughly unsatisfying game experience.

The game is a kind of action/survival horror story, with you playing as Edward Carnby, trapped in a collapsing and monster-filled New York. Right from the start the controls will baffle you, and they conspire against you having any decent fun at every single opportunity.

Yes it's that bad. The game is almost unplayable due to the terrible, unresponsive and sometimes downright un-useable control system. Nothing works well. In several chapters, Carnby has to climb up and down ropes and swing about to reach ledges. The implementation of this makes it impossible to judge when to let go. Then there are the car driving sections...awful cars that don;'t even drive in a straight line even when you don't push the L-stick at all, and which spin off into instant death at the slightest clipping of any obstacle. Then there's the fighting...a gun that can only be fired in 1st person. Melee weapons that can only be swung in 3rd person. And both with a real time lag. Then there's the camera, constantly wobbling and bouncing around behind Carnby's head. You can't see the scenery or anything very clearly, let alone where you are running. Thank heavens the 3rd person viewpoint actually keeps still. Then there's the inventory...all in your pockets which you have to look in and pick things out of. Then there's the first aid packs and general healing. How does this work? I don't even know. And then there is...eyes-closed mode. Oh my god. Words fail me when trying to describe how terrible this is. You try keeping the R3 button held down without actually tipping it from side to side. And right at the end of the game theres a perilous twisting catwalk with instant death drops at each side to traverse, that you can only SEE in eyes-closed mode. I can guarantee you will be screaming. Screaming for your money back, probably. I'll say this though, the game designers have been fiendish in making you work out exactly what you have to do. There are no clues. Walk into a museum with a couple of monsters in it and there is no way out. Not a single clue. Walk into a factory where the floor is covered with deadly slime. ""Use the spotlights"" some helpful dame says. How? The panel has no instructions on it. And worst of all is the saving...save spots are at set points, and if you die somehow you often have to go back and do some tortuous skill-based action sequence over and over again, as many of the set-pieces are trial and error based. Hideous.

Now that just leaves the graphics, and these are no champions either. Characters are blocky and awkward. Carnby has this awful gaunt square-jawed hero face that looks really ugly. I have seen better graphics on PS2 games from five years ago! The collision detection is awful, and Carnby was forever teetering on invisible cliff edges or falling off when he should have been standing safely.

But I persevered and played it right to the end, bracing myself for a very uncomfortable finale...but let me tell you though, I was gobsmacked by the feeble winding up of the game. I actually thought I had got the ""bad"" ending and had missed out an entire final level. But no...a final nail in the coffin. Oh well at least I was happy that I could stop playing it.

Which is fine, but I think it shoots itself in the foot with its design decisions.  Some aspects of this game are just plain annoying/frustrating (to me).  I realize that weapons are supposed to deteriorate after some use, but it seems just way too quick.  I guess they were going after a sense of tension, or perhaps they wanted everyone to frantically run around like headless chickens looking for the next piece of junk to pick up to bash some zombies with.  All I got out of this element is frustration and irritation.

Inventory management sucks, maybe they were going after realism or something...in a zombie game.  Its annoying to deal with (menus) and extremely limited in storage, forcing you to always decide what to drop and what to pick up.  Tension I guess, whoopdy doo, if you want tension, get a job.  I just wanted to relax with some mindless zombie bashing, not having to make constantly annoying decisions about what junk to use when.

Recipes, guess to each their own, I'm not into that, not interested in playing chef/mechanic with street junk.

Zombies swarm you constantly, as if they're tunneling from China straight to your feet.  More tension I guess, this might have been fun, but taking them down is just annoying, endless button mashing with weapons that might as well be Styrofoam bats.

All in all, its the only dead rising I've ever tried, and my experience guarantees it'll be the only one I ever will.

Too bad they didn't think ahead enough to perhaps include some 'noob' mode, where the whole point is to complete the story while having FUN.  Where weapons last 10 times longer, or perhaps just last forever for those of us that aren't interested in the crafting minigames.

First, they promote the game as featuring model Anja Rubik. There's a big picture of her on the cover. And yes, you get maybe 1 minute TOTAL of video of her talking throughout the game, in little pieces. She - very rarely - will appear to tell you about her love of yoga or to encourage you. That's it.

The rest of the time you have atrociously drawn characters who seem to be from a N64 era guiding you around. I kid you not. The graphics are some of the worst I've ever seen on a modern era system. The avatars look like they've been beaten by their husbands.

There are three main modes. Practice mode shows you the list of poses to choose from. You can look through the different poses, choose one, and see it demonstrated for you. Then you can do it on your own, with the on screen avatar simply guiding you. The backgrounds are random ""room with wood floor and a window perhaps"" animations. You can see them from all four sides.

On to the routine mode. In this mode you get a few set choices: arthritis, backache, cold, home, obesity, student, abdominal, headache, heart. NONE of these matched anything I wanted to do. How about stress? Where are USEFUL routines?

These routines send you through a set routine, but there are NO audio prompts! Your on screen person goes into pose 1 - so say bow pose. Then they suddenly go into plough pose, and since you're trying to do the pose properly and look down, you have no idea! You look up and they're in pose #3! The most they say is ""breathe"" randomly. There's boppy techno-Indian music in the background. There's no warning of how long the routine will be, and at the end maybe they go into corpse pose to relax, but the techno-Indian music continues, and you're only in it for maybe 8 seconds anyway. There is no ability to create your own routines.

OK, maybe story mode is better. You get to choose from 4 guides, 2 male, 2 female. Then you enter a pixellated temple. You move from ""painting"" to ""painting"" and get a two to three line description about each one, about what a yoga pose does for you or how to eat in a healthy manner. I am starting to finally get enthusiastic. Some of the areas of this temple are pretty and I look forward to roaming it later. I skip the areas where it shows me a painting of a pose and says ""try this pose"". Then suddenly it says to go to the second floor. I agree. After 20 minutes I realize there are four floors to this temple and that the entire temple is SOLELY a ""It's a Small World"" ride. The only way to move through these floors is to follow the poorly animated virtual avatar around and hear her awful animated scripts. You can't walk through the koi pond or the sand garden on your own. Not only do you have to listen to the awful, repetitive script but you have to press A repeatedly just to get through a floor.

If you agree at any point to ""try the pose"" demonstrated in a painting, it in essence goes into the training mode. You have the option to have the pose demonstrated to you, and you can ""try the pose"" with a random person and random environment. The guide you have chosen is gone. You of course never see Anja Rubik demonstrating anything.

You're also stuck with the guide you choose at the beginning. Want to try a different guide? Create a different profile.

OK, well the game is awful and the graphics are awful. How about the information being presented? First, Anja Rubik says in her very brief appearances that yoga is not about religion. It's about inner balance. But the rest of the video talks strongly about connecting to the cosmic energy and how the Indians created this religious system over a thousand years ago.

What should you eat? Apparently if you eat overheated foods you become self centered, insecure, and IGNORANT. OK, I can understand food choices making you hyper, but IGNORANT?? Food choices erase your memory?

And then there's the ""restless"" foods. They include spicy, coffee, tea, chocolate. OK, I get the angst about caffeine. But fish, garlic, and meat? If you eat garlic and fish you become restless? How about omega-3 oils being healthy for you??

Apparently the ""proper"" diet involves fruits, grains, milk, vegetables, nuts, and beans. This is just a bit too much.

The scary avatars smile at you - without moving - while the messages transmit telepathically. When the poses are shown, with no verbal cues at all, a creepy set of lungs inhale and exhale in the corner. The rooms shown have wooden bars across the windows to keep you from escaping.

I adore yoga, and this DVD was so atrocious that I cannot even imagine who I will send the game to to review it next. For environmental reasons I cannot bring myself to throw it out, and the only purpose to forward it would be to allow others to spread the word about how bad it is. Every dollar we own is precious.

For this outing into the SoF world however, it seems the only aspect of the game the designers tried to get right was the violent detachment of limbs.

The AI is horrible - teammates/escorts enjoy crossing your line of fire and charging headfirst at enemies.  Enemies frequently ignore your presence until you've dispatched half a group - in the first level, on hard, a pair of terrorists ran out into the street in front of me... and turned the wrong way, allowing me to cut them down from behind easily.

When the enemies aren't being stupid, they're busy being omniscient.  Don't bother equipping a silencer on your weapon, as it seems that shots fired from it attract more attention than an un-silenced assault rifle.

1.0,False,"05 16, 2012",AFEQ9MCMMWD9E,B00178630A,Sunan Peebles,"I played D1 and D2 quite a bit. For a time, I played on Battle.net, and eventually collected some good items and had a fairly strong onlne character, but eventually I hated it (thanks to Blizzard's management and policies which did not allow you to host a non-P2P online game, and server lags from time to time). I loved playing D2 and LOD on my LAN though. No issues with hacking, because I and my group could control everything. I was foolish enough to buy and install D3 without realizing that there would be no LAN play, and no offline single player. So again, in D3 Blizzard made another major decision restricting players' freedom: internet only.

With D2, I had no problems with hacking or server lag, because I abandoned Battle.net. From my point of view, D3 is like the result of a doctor transplanting hemorrhoids to a healthy patient.

Let's review some of the arguments posted on this forum:

1) ""Things will be better after Blizzard resolves the server problems, and eventually there will be fewer users at any given time.""

For those who like online play and can accept off-and-on laggy servers or down servers at the worst possible moment, that is probably true. And Amazon ratings for D3 may go up. It is not true for me, because I have no desire to play on Battle.net. D3 will be a 1 star product from my point of view forever.

2) ""You should have known.""

That is true, but remember that many of us had been playing D2 for 12 years, and we were used to the freedom of being able to play offline. We did not imagine that Blizzard would remove that freedom in D3.

Imagine that you have been driving a certain brand of car for many years. This brand has built in ONSTAR and GPS, but up to now you could operate the car without being connected to those services. You go in and buy the latest model. The sales agent says that you have to have ONSTAR/GPS connected, but it's free. That's kind of strange, but you buy it anyway. Then you realize that you can't even drive the car without being connected. I realize that allowing a car to be returned is very different from allowing opened software to be returned, but I want Blizzard to realize that some of us will not trust them in the future. I will not ever buy from Blizzard again.

3) ""We can all blame the pirates.""

Let's see if I've got this straight. Blizzard could not control the hacking on battle.net, and so the solution is to force everyone onto battle.net, where the same hackers could attack the servers I am forced to use, and possibly attack the ports on my network that battle.net uses.

4) ""You are not rating the game, you are rating battle.net.""

The game IS battle.net now.

5) ""You clicked on the AGREE button when you installed it.""

If I had not agreed to the terms, I could not learn what it's like to play, and then you would say I don't know what I am talking about. Catch-22.

6) ""Online is the trend. It is inevitable.""

Mostly they just lose them, so we decided to buy the first headphones we've bought in a long time.  I showed the kids the headphones before I ordered them, and they were ecstatic!  The headphones cancel out distractions in a busy house/car, and we (the parents) like that they are more hygienic and harder to misplace.

I ordered one each of the Amazon Basic and the Sony MDRZX100, at essentially the same price.  I received both at the same time, and I couldn't believe what I saw.  The Amazon headphones look like the ones you get at the dollar store.  The head pad is just cheap foam, and the ear pads are simply glued in place.  To me, the biggest indicator of the poor quality was the cables.  Amazon cuts off the photo right where the cables get very thin--about 1/4 as thick as Sony.  If the Amazon headphones hadn't literally fallen to pieces within a few days of ordinary use, I was quite certain the tiny cables would have frayed in less than a month.  As it happened, the ear pads were the first to go.  They show absolutely no signs of wear; they just came apart where they were shoddily glued on.

So, help me out here, Amazon.  I love shopping on here!  I especially love the user ratings--when they are based on product use rather than nostalgia.  For any given small ticket item like headphones, mice, etc., there are literally thousands of Amazon listings for poorly designed and cheaply made knock offs.

There is a fair amount of story, and it is typical anime fair.  It was written in 1997, so the premise is kind of funny/anachronistic.  I guess the internet and a connected city were futuristic back then.  The characters are 1 dimensional, and pretty dull.  The voice acting is top notch though.

The gameplay really shows its age.  Released in 1997, you can expect pretty basic movements and dungeon quality.  Moving requires the use of the 3ds' crappy d-pad.  It is very very annoying,  especially after playing Persona 4 Golden.

The art is Ok, but really blurry and low rez, especially during battles.  Part of the fun of these games is the monster design.  Again, Persona4 Golden on the Vita was great for that.  SMT: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers on 3ds is really bad in this dept.

When I finally found the wood, her health dropped to 43% and kept dropping even after I made the fire.

By the way, building the fire was not fun. You have to keep pressing the L and R buttons (DS owners KNOW these buttons are fragile and will stop functioning if pressed to hard or *way* to many times, especially the L-button [Google it if you don't believe me]) repeatedly until a bar turns red, then you blow into the mic to start the fire. Nice, except you HAVE TO do this EVERYTIME the fire goes out, EVERY night or the girl will freeze to death and die.

Making food from clams and sea-weed was cute, but frustrating, as it did not bring health points back to 100%. The amount of HP recovered is based apon how well the food was enjoyed or prepared. If it was not enjoyed, you got a small amount of HP. The most I saw when the meal was OK was 19 pts. By the way, what is the POINT of having a REST system if it ONLY applies to you?

with some fiddling I got it connected on the OSX side anyway, but the thing disconnects CONSTANTLY. Not only that but in games every time you enter a menu, when you exit, this mouse points your view straight up. Between that and the constant disconnects this mouse is absolutely worthless for everything, especially gaming. I'm not even going to bother trying it on the Windows 8 side. This thing is still junk.

In short-
Calling it a gaming mouse is misleading. It barely functions as a mouse
Calling it Bluetooth compatible is misleading since most of the functions require the dongle
Calling it OSX compatible is misleading since they don't give you any instructions to connect it on OSX and, if the tech support guy is right, it won't work at all on older Macs with BT 3.0- which part of what makes Bluetooth a useful technology is that it's backwards compatible.

I'll say it again: Junk.

*Original Review*
There are no instructions to pair the mouse to OSX- it just says in the booklet ""consult the manual for your equipment manufacturer. Following the directions for Windows 8 on the Windows 8 partition of my Mac I discovered that the thing won't enter pairing mode. It says to hold down the wing button and precision mode button for 5 secconds until the blue LED quits flashing for 3 seconds. That never happens and both OS's fail to connect to it without entering pairing mode. I'm not about to use a dongle- that's why I spent 60 freaking dollars on a bluetooth mouse- to free up a USB port and keep from having to worry about losing the stupid dongle. So far it's the only Bluetooth device I've ever used that has required tech support to get the thing paired and connected and as such it gets a big fat F. We'll see if tech support gets it resolved but based on the other reviews I'm not holding out much hope. And also I'm packing it back up to go back to where it came from because I found a different mouse that works fine, so Mad Katz tech support has a limited amount of time.

i did the standard ""i play games on a PC"" thing - download latest drivers, instal patches, Google for hours, read the support forums, etc. It seems like spending hours trying to figure out why a game won't work is a part of the PC gaming experience, which as i was reading the 30th ""yeah, i get that exact same error but i also can't find a workaround and the company won't respond to forum posts or emails"" i realized was pretty sad. Some games crash occasionally (Dark Messiah), some frequenty (SiN Episode 1), some are unconscionably laggy (Mass Effect) and some work perfectly (Half-Life 2, Gears of War, Oblivion, Neverwinter Nights 2, at least on my new computer, etc.). TimeShift is the first one where i have never, ever even seen the game run in any way, shape or form. i wondered why a game so many people said they liked was being sold so cheap. Yes, the game is old, but even old games these days sell for at least $20. Now i know. The game has been out long enough that all tech problems should be patched now but i'm finding plenty of people having problems and all of them have exactly the same error with the same error message that's 100% reproducible and not one person has gotten it working - that sounds to me like the problem that is easiest to solve (widely seen, perfectly reproducible).

For the record, my PC is well above min specs. XP 32 bit, dual core 3000, 8800GTX, 4GB RAM, etc.

For my part, i think 6 hours is enough of my time trying to make a game work. Considering what i make per hour, this game has wasted enough of my time that i can buy a console where i know the games work. It's not worth making this game worth. It's going in the trash.

A recommendation for others that i wish i had thought of earlier - a lot of people are saying the demo for this game freezes.

In retrospect, I don't like FFXII because it is an RPG/RTS hybrid, and the two genres didn't mesh well here.

  Pros:

  - Most of the in game functions take place using the touch screen, as
  it should be

  - You get to summon classic FF monsters to aid you in battle (and most
  of them don't just vanish after launching one attack)

  - You play as a band of pirates (arr!) who are searching for treasure
  (and will inevitably end up saving the world if Square follows its
  usual storyline)

  - All of the maps are strewn with treasure chests

  - Unlike in Fire Emblem, you don't permanently lose a party member if
  they die in battle

  Cons:

  - The random nature of some of the characters.  One of them is a
  crocodile.  Why?

  - No squad system to make controlling your armies simple.  Instead, you
  have to do a square select to control multiple units.  And this becomes
  a pain when you have large armies.

  - If all party members die its game over, an RPG element that is really
  annoying in an RTS.

  - You command your army using the touch screen, but most maps are so
  huge that it takes forever to go and issue a command.

  - You have to go and select the spawn points in order to summon new
  monsters, and then you have to give them orders once they spawn.

  - At the start of each battle, you can only select 5 monsters to summon
  during the battle

  - Player AIs.  All of your AIs, including your own party, are pacifists
  that will stop attacking if you aren't spamming the attack order via
  the touch screen.  So if you have to go do something off screen, your
  units become completely useless.

  - The above flaws make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to go
  after the treasure chests without losing.

  - Enemy AIs don't suffer from the flaws that the player AIs do.",This game had a lot of potential but fails to deliver,1290816000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

They are 100% right it is way better than the first one, but still a turd. I have been playing the piece of crap for the last 3 days becuase I have nothing else except the games I have already beaten. The backdrops and views are great, and that is about as far as it goes. It takes about an hour to hour and a half to just be able to actually do anything interesting. The Italian Accent and dialouge is pitiful. I think that the designers were trying to draw you in but teh only thing good about the cut-scenes is it gives you a chance to leave and use the bathroom, or get a drink. The Controls are horrible. If you are running by a ladder and anywhere near it Enzio wil hop on it but when you need to reach the next ledge while climbing you can pretty much bet on Enzio just jumping off the building altogether. there is a dream sequence where you have to climb a tower and the camera pans around and shows you where to go, but it will take you forever becuase Enzio just plain out refuses to climb the thing. The controls are what make me the angriest. You will find yourself wondering why you are still playing. And as far as repetition, well It is still pretty much the same thing go kill these guys silently go kill these guys loud, now go pickpocket this guy. Really boring. But I will say this I have been playing for a long time and I think I am close to the end finally, but the game does have some length. Another thing I don't understand is at times you will have like 10 guys ""fighting"" you but they attack one at a time. I am not sure but I am betting that you could defeat even the toughest of enemies with the lowest quality armor and weapons. Which leads you to the question why buy better armor. The answer, it is the only thing to spend the abundance of money that you make. You will have enough money to buy everything really quickly. I just walk around throwing it now.

From the moment i popped it into my 360 Elite to when i popped it back out after a couple hours of campaign and a few games of multiplayer. I already sold it back to GameStop. Epic should change their company name to Epic Fail because they sure did drop the ball on this game.

Where do i even start? I guess i'll start with the campaign. It's decent, just a Gears of War 1 rehash, nothing more. Definitely forgettable. The dialogue is completely childish and immature this time around throughout the entire game. Dom does nothing but [...] all game, it gets really old after about the first mission. It just feels so clunky and thrown off.

Now onto my favorite mode and what kills the game for me, Multiplayer. What the heck was Cliffy B smoking when he made this game? The multiplayer is a sheer disaster. Instead of being able to chose what type of game mode you want to play you have to vote now. You can't even choose your team. It's like Halo 3 gone wrong. It's just bad. The shotgun, which was the best weapon and most fun in Gears of War 1 has been completely dumbed down and is now one of the weakest weapons in the game. This game caters to all the Gears of War 1 cry babies that sucked at the game. If you were a lancer noob from Gears of War 1 this game will probably be right down your alley.

1/5 stars, would of gave it zero if i could. Don't buy this game, don't even rent it. Save your money, Gears 2 is just a rehash of the first game that hasn't improved at all.

1.0,False,"12 18, 2004",A2WLDEORTNRY0D,B0001NJHH8,SBJ400,"My first piece of advise - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL AN OFFICIAL PATCH IS RELEASED! ((I am not the only person saying this))Even then you should be leery until maybe a 2nd patch is out! This game is LOADED with bugs, the graphics engine consumes your CPU and RAM no matter how powerful your system is! Please read on - I don't hate this game...I just think they should have tested it before releasing it to the public.

There are many fansites with forums. In the forums you will find people screaming and yelling from the rooftops about how bad, buggy and choppy this game is!

Let me make myself clear and explain what I mean by BETA for those that do not know.

When a software company creates a program it typically goes through several stages before being released. BETA is a version that is ALMOST ready for sale to the public but needs to go through test drives first to hunt and find problems, crashes, bugs, mistakes, etc. This version would not be sold or released to the public for widespread use. NO WAY!

A release that is ready for widespread public use or sale is called a GOLD or RTM version. This means that it runs beautifully, very few bugs or crash problems, if any!

WELL, Vampires: Bloodlines is NOTHING BUT A BETA!!!!!!!! I can prove it. Keep reading!

I have a P4, ATI X800, 2 GB CORSAIR RAM....etc. You name it, I have nothing but top of the line, latest and greatest.

This game chugs along. It consumes over 750 MB's of RAM when being run, I get choppy frames, and lots of lag at times!

How can this be? Easy, this game was not meant to be released so soon. I think there was pressure to get it out before X-mas!!!! The code and graphics engine behind this game was not ready for retail release.

Bloodlines crashes at certain parts of the game, lip sync is off on many characters, some missions of the game cannot be completed, graphics errors and goof ups abound while playing the game, the combat action is TERRIBLE, involuntary switching from 1st to 3rd person disrupts your game play!! I could go on and on!

The GOOD -

Diverse campaigns/missions, funny interaction with characters, some interesting weapons to use, very creative game with clever ideas and lots of thought put into the concept.

The BAD -

Missions become repetitive, lots of level transitions that TAKE FOREVER TO LOAD!!!!! Lot's of talking about meaningless things with characters. It almost seems like they added this crap just to keep you busy! The graphics are nice but the characters are stiff and unrealistic looking.

The UGLY -

Parts of game cannot be completed successfully, parts of game cause you to crash to desktop, there is an unofficial patch but it does not work under many circumstances, slow load times, choppy framerates, music and voice sync is off in many situations. The worst part is the collision detection part of the graphics engine. (Translation -You can be stopped dead in your tracks by a measely drinking cup or piece of chair on the floor while just walking, but worst of all while being shot at or chased!!!

1.0,False,"03 12, 2008",A1M4VNSBHB6NS3,B000RHZ9JI,Gorilla,"The taste in my mouth: (before the actual review)

This game is bad.  I mean, what marketing focus group decided the two main characters (white guys) would talk in surfer ebonics?  Does that somehow increase the game's appeal to an inner-city 16-24 crowd?  Don't even get me started on ""pimping"" your weapons with the money you earn.  I'm not talking about customizing appearance or effectiveness (one of the things that earned this game two stars of fun), but simply changing the weapon's appearance like a cheesy late-90s hip hop video would.

If it sounds like I'm ragging on hip hop culture, ebonics, or anything like that, forget it...it's just that I'm mystified as to why this game would include such over-the-top, cheesy content at EVERY TURN.  On to the review:

A rundown:

Plot/Dialogue:  SO...CHEESY.  After the first 20 minutes, you're dreading the cutscenes (they look pretty, though).  What predictable plot twist will come next?  What cool-guy quip will the dorky characters blurt out?  Pathetic.  I'll bet you can guess the first plot twist before it's even introduced.  Just come up with the most clichee, overused device you can imagine.

Controls/Feel: Playable.  Smooth, but player movement and animation feels clunky.  Like Gears of War without the realism or fun.  Aiming while running or maneuvering around obstacles is tough (not in a realistic way; in an annoying way).  The one thing that really gets to you after an hour or so is the player death/healing animations and the hand-to-hand animations.  Often you'll find yourself involuntarily going into one of these slow, unstoppable animations in the middle of combat when you'd rather get behind some cover.  You will die because of this.  Often, if you're playing on the harder difficulties.  Also, when playing in co-op, joystick sensitivity can't be individually adjusted (and there's only 3 settings, none of which seem quite right after Halo, Gears, etc).

AI: Crappy.  Everything even mildly cool that enemies do in the game is scripted.  The AI itself is extremely basic.  It feels like you're fighting the same two types of enemies for the entire game, they just keep getting progressively harder to kill.  No personality, no backstory to the enemy types...they're just mindless drones that you kill in hordes.  Fun for an hour or two.  Boring for the rest of the game.

Level Design: Boring.  Cosmetically, the levels all look good after you get past Afghanistan and Iraq...even reasonably different from each other.  It's always the same cover placement, though, and the levels always work the same way.  It gets really repetitive after a while.  By the end, the co-op partner I had started with had abandoned me, and I was figuring out where the ambushes would come from just by seeing where the cover was placed.  Sound crazy?  That's the kind of mental acrobatics you'll be playing with yourself if you try to push through the entire game...just to keep it SOMEHOW entertaining.

Co-Op:  A friend of mine shelled out the better part of $60 for this game.  We played for half an hour on the normal difficulty and turned off the console.  He was so disappointed that he gave the game to me to finish (so I could write this review).  This is a guy who LOVES shooters, who LOVES co-op.  Sadly, the co-op actions in this game (co-op snipe, jump steps, etc) are SO contrived and useless, it feels like they were just added on at the end of the game design.  You will run into bridges that have little holes JUST so you can jump-step up on the other side, so you feel like there's still some ""co-op action"" going on.  Two words: BS.

Graphics/Hud: The HUD sucks.  It's hard to see your crosshairs for the first 20 minutes of the game (until you stop looking for them).  Graphics aren't nearly as good as Gears of War, which came out a looong time ago.

PROS:  The game sucks, but there ARE a few small things that don't.  To be fair, I'm including them...although nothing can stop this game from trainwrecking in the first 25 minutes.

Autosaving is GREAT.  I feel like I would have chucked this game across the living room if I'd had to replay large sections of it.  The game's autosaving is as seamless and helpful as I've ever seen in a game (if only Splinter Cell: Double Agent had implemented something like this!).  It really saved me a ton of time and frustration.

Customizing your weapons is fun, too.  Too bad there's no way to sell off weapons you've been using to invest in the bigger, better ones by the end of the game.  Oh well.

OVERALL:

Props to the programmers, animators, art guys, etc....all the ""grunts"" who worked on this game.  It runs smooth, looks pretty, and all the technical stuff seems to work just fine.  You guys did a great job.  Where this game utterly fails is the concept/design itself.  What happened?

Seriously, what went wrong?  Too many focus groups diluting the core ideas that could have made this game cool?  Too much marketing BS about making the game more attractive to a wider audience?  The idea could have been cool, if the concept had just been left alone.  As it is, though, everything about Army of Two feels totally overproduced.  It's like a bunch of 50-year old white guys were trying too hard to make it ""cool""...which resulted in laughably bad dialogue/characters, an ""I've-seen-it-a-million-times"" plot, and BORING gameplay.  No amount of pimping my AK-47 can fix that.

If any part of you still thinks this game could be cool, RENT IT FIRST.  You'll see what I'm talking about.  If you still love it, then buy it, but I think that advice will save a ton of people $55 that they could invest in something else.

Good luck to those who've already sunk cash into this game.  Try to get rid of it while the marketing hype is still going, because after that no one will want it.  A total loss.

Because this game is absolute garbage. Compared to previous games from THQ all 2K have done is added a thing or two here and there and changed this and that but essentially there is no improvements... In-fact some of the features have been downgraded and screwed up.

Firstly, no infinite finishers... But what's even worse is the new percentage meters that need to be at certain levels before you can do your finishers and OMG moments. WHY? What on Earth where 2k thinking of changing that for what they have put in here? It's botched the fun of multiplayer up and made it irritating rather than fun. What moron at THQ came up with the idea? Or was it a group desicion? Fire them all, they don't deserve payment for their contribution to numbskull desicion of the year.

The controls are not smoothly responsive at all. Stupid parts where my character just pauses and stands there allowing the opponent to take over ... Stop lying to us 2k about your bs smooth enhanced better than ever controls, because it's not. It's one of the worst ever.

And enough with the damn button moments during matches... It's not fun at all to watch and be told what button to press and when during cut scenes to progress or not ... Scrap that idea already and come up with something fun to play rather than the same old boring timed sequence rubbish.

AND GET RID OF THE PERCENTAGE THING AND GIVE US BACK OUR INFINITE FINISHERS AND ALLOW US TO CHOOSE TO USE THEM WHEN WE WANT AND AS MUCH AS WE WANT.

2k need to rethink the whole game and actually put some effort into these games and stop treating them as cash cows once a year. WWE need to allow other companies to license a game or two for them so that 2k stop being lazy and figure no matter what they release it will sell, because there is no competition , and that sort of thinking is unfair on the gamers who just want a good solid wrestling game that has had a lot of work put into it.

This has to be the BIGGEST disappointment I have personally EVER had as a video game player/owner.  I had such monumental high hopes for it and it fell flat on EVERY level.
Let's take a look and see how THQ dropped the ball...
#1 - Possibly the worst Create-A-Wrestler ever!  Costumes, colors, faces, masks, are extremely limited (or else so goofy you'd never want to use them).  Games for the PSX and N64 completely dominate the pitful options here.  Forget trying to make any ECW, WCW, or super-hero characters!  You're limited to three skin colors and only 9 color options for clothing (no text additions on shirts either).
#2 - Limited match options!  NO CAGE MATCH!  NO ROYAL RUMBLE!  NO SURVIVOR SERIES!  NO BLOOD!  NO LUMBERJACK!  Come on!!!!  Games like Warzone and Attitude for the PSX even had these options!  And correct me if I'm wrong, weren't some of these options supposedly offered when the game was being previewed?
#3 - Confusing game play!  Although the moves and fighting style are nice, the camera angle shifts WAY too often to allow you to stay focused.
#4 - Music and Save options!  Compare this game to the other Xbox offerings like Gotham City Racing (for the music) or Halo (for save and game options) and you'll be crying in your soup.  On a hard drive the size of the Xbox this game actually limits you in saving CAW and match options!  LIMITS the size of 16 wrestlers!  PHAW!
I could go on and on about why I think this game is a titanic waste of time, money, and expectations but I won't.

I have the same experience on a imac with a bluetooth keyboard, a logitec RF usb keyboard, and a straight up wired lenovo USB keyboard and a Macbook with its builtin keyboard. They told me ""laptops"" aren't supported, despite clearly having laptops (Macbooks specifically)  in almost all the promo materials for the game. Anyway, I submitted the issue on Ubisoft support and they replied telling me that they don't support controllers- they only support the microsoft Xbox 360 controller, and to go to Windows> control panel and update my drivers. Erm... is a keyboard a controller? Not sure. Regardless OSX doesn't have a windows button or a control panel and as far as keyboards go, doesn't use manually configurable drivers.

So I called them and asked. They said it's not a known issue and that I'd need to wait for engineers to receive a problem ticket and address the issue. Google ""rocksmith mac keyboard"" and you'll quickly realize that's not a one time issue but seems to affect ALL MACS. yes. All... Macs.... Everywhere. No controlling guitarcade for you.

That falls under the 700 category but is technically a ""laptop version""Older  Macs use 600 versions which aren't supported at all.  The new Mac Pro's don't even use theATI  Raedon cards- they use ATI Firepro line. Technically the Firepro line should be pretty similar (identical) to the Raedon line but with some upgrades. Speaking in a strictly legal sense- that excludes ALL macs. iMacs and Macbooks use a ""laptop GPU"" Mac Pro's since 2013 don't even have the option of installing a second hand compatible GPU. Legally Ubisoft only supports a handful of 2012 Mac Pro's with a specific GPU & processor configuration.

I called Nintendo and sent it in for repair.  They email me back with a $65 plus tax & shipping rate to fix the console.  They said it wasn't covered under warranty because it was ""abused"".  I called the Nintendo repair phone number to complain that was not the case.  They claimed that the socket to plug into electrical outlet was loose which was affecting it being powered on, so it wasn't covered under warranty.  They said my son must have been rough with unplugging the console.  I told them that my son barely played with it and he has taken care not to handle it roughly.  Anyways, after getting transferred to a manager, I complained that the product must be defective and that I had just spent over $300 for that console & mentioned I have spent a lot of money on other Nintendo products (Original Nintendo, Gameboys, Wii, etc).  She lowered the cost of the repair at $30 and told me that if it had same or another issue, they would just replace it since it just might be a defective product.

Fast forward almost a year later (February 2014), the 3DS touch screen just stopped working in the middle of a game.  Sent it in for repair again and received same pricing.  They claimed that the console has liquid damage which is BS because my son did not spill anything on it.  I truly believe Nintendo will say it's some other damage that isn't covered under warranty.  They claim that their products is covered under warranty, but in actuality, they will claim some other issue like abuse to not have to honor their warranty!

It's all form and no function.  You'll rarely play a better looking game.  If graphics are paramount for you, then by all means, this is your game.

The troublesome fact is that for every detailed animation or carefully crafted level, it seems like they designed the game to make a good looking trailer.  Once you're in the game, the mechanics are pretty awful.  For starters, the weapons are a joke.  For example, Assault class has essentially two weapons.  An SMG, or a shotgun.  Sure, there are numerous variants for both guns, but compare that to BF4 where you had dozens of weapons and dozens of attachments for each weapon, and BF1 feels like a demo by comparison.  The levels are another example.  While it's fantastic that you can deform the earth, level buildings, and knock down trees, it means nothing when the level itself is lopsided in one sides favor.  When fog or heavy rain rolls in, you just want to sit there and watch, because it looks amazing...but dare to venture out into battle and you'll fall victim to all the stupid little ways you will be unjustly killed.  A lot of reviews make this out like it's some broader commentary on the pointless and random deaths that made up WWI.  I think it's more about them just building a monster they no longer control.  You'll get bombed.  You'll spawn right in front of guys(or if you're lucky, right behind them).  You'll realize you can only toss a grenade like 20 feet, which is laughable.  You'll get headshot over and over while your weapon barely takes off 40% health.  There will be bugs and random glitches that result in your death.  You'll see bullets fly right through the enemy.  You'll come up behind someone and unload in their back only to have them turn around and one-shot you.  And then there are the hacks.  I'm starting to see more and more players kicked from games due to cheating.  This absolutely kills the fun because the second someone gets a lucky shot or is just flat out better than you, it's extremely difficult to shake the idea that he's just cheating.  Before long, it's all you can think about while you're waiting to respawn.

It's games like this that make me go back to single-player, which btw, BF1's single player is a joke.  It's nothing more than a glorified set of training missions that doesn't even really train you.  For example, the airplane missions don't even have rudder control.  But once you get into multiplayer, rudder control is there.  Just a beautiful hot mess.","All looks, no brains",1479772800,4,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Upon opening and setting up the new console, I was excited to get the initial set up complete and throw in Titanfall and start playing. My excitement quickly faded when the initial set-up/download took over an hour and a half. After the download for the set-up was finished, I decided to check my internet connection and it was working at a fast speed with no foreseeable problems which drew more questions. I then went to type in the code to download the Titanfall game that was included in my bundle. After close to 3 hours, the download was only at 7% and I became worried. Still not wanting to give up on the Xbox one before I had even played it yet, I decided to throw in a game my wife had gotten and the console made me do an immediate update for her game which only took half an hour. Once the update was completed, it made me download the game to the hard drive which took an hour and a half. After her game finally finished downloading, she played it for about 20 minutes before we headed to bed for the night. Thinking that leaving the console for the next few hours to let Titanfall download seemed like a good idea. When I woke up in the morning and not only had the game not downloaded but the Xbox had turned off right after I went to sleep. When I turned the console on in the morning, the download had stopped and had gone back down to 1%. Just to be clear, I don't have a slow internet connection and the downloads were still taking forever to get anywhere at all. I've always been a fan of Microsoft, but it seems like they're going away from wanting to have user friendly systems and wanting to make a non-user friendly system that's as high tech as they can get it with taking away from user control. This is the worst system I've ever purchased and I will have a full refund by the end of the week. Despite the positive reviews on this page, please read user reviews online and you'll see the massive amount of complaints dealing with incredibly slow download times. A few things to keep in mind before purchasing this console..... the graphics are the exact same as the 360. Also, when a new system comes out for purchase there are several things you expect. You should expect it to be more streamlined and smaller with the new technology that's out there. With the xbox one, you get none of these things. The console itself is big and bulky and the new Kinect is twice as big as the 360 version. If you're seriously considering purchasing the Xbox One and are a fan of Microsoft gaming consoles, please just stick with the Xbox 360 and like I stated before, if you don't believe my review, look on all the Xbox One blogs online and you'll see how much it really is sinking in popularity.

6 June 2014**** Update. Talked to Microsoft about snail speed download times and I was told that's been happening a lot and they are working on it.

This is the third out of four PS Vita Slim protector brands I have tried. This Hori failed me just like the brands Gam3Gear and Akwox. Only the brand Mr Shield did everything I wanted from any screen protector. Anyways, I read the comments and watched videos of how to apply this Hori screen protector so I came prepared. I used a strong electric air blower and a keyboard vacuum during the whole installation process. I wanted to make sure no dust was anywhere on the device screens. I even made sure to blow dry the underside that you are suppose to peel off, steps 2 and 3 backing sheets. So when it is slowly being peeled off it hopefully wouldn't drop any dust particles all over the screen when the protector starts to adhere onto the device. Steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 process was a pain for the first PS Vita device I installed this on. There was a lot of particles that got caught when the two backing got peeled off, sigh. I had to use scotch tape onto the protector to lift it and remove the particles stuck under the actual screen protector. It was not a fun process.

No matter how much I pressed the protector, the rainbow effect just wouldn't go away. I ended up applying a different protector (Mr Shield) on the second device that worked so much better and took less than 3 minutes to apply. I will be removing this Hori protector off the first device as I don't feel it will protect my screen at all. Waste of $30 for 2 of these terrible Hori film ""protectors"".

This protector is also not edge to edge size as I was hoping for. It is also one of the thinnest screen protector I have ever come across... so thin you wonder if it'll even protect anything. It's thinner than the protective backing that you peel off the protector during application. It also has an annoying straight line in the middle of the protector from the peel off backing. It comes in 2 separate backing film that you peel right then the left (steps 2 and 3). Step 1 is a tab you peel off the back and it's what you use to stick onto the screen while you align the protector. This step 1 was useless because as you start peeling off the backing, the whole protector starts to move around even when you are firmly pressing it down. The only positive things I can say about this protector is how invisible it looks once applied and how easy it was to get the bubbles out. The thinness of this item is what makes it look seamless and almost invisible. The question is, how much will it actually protect your screen? This is literally like the film you find on brand new electronic devices when you first buy them that protects it from fingerprints... even though this Hori still catches fingerprints like crazy.

For the price and only getting one thin film type ""protector"" per kit, I'd look elsewhere if you are serious about keeping your screen from any serious scratches.

ETA: I decided to play with my Vita before removing this Hori protector. I didn't like the feel of the protector at all, had a very semi-rough cheap film feeling to it. There was some missed touch screen responses that had me worried that it might of been my brand new Vita, but come to find out it wasn't soon as I did the Welcome Park app. The line that I mention in my original review was annoyingly visible during gameplays that had white/light colored backgrounds. It's hard to capture a close up picture of the imperfections unless you see them in person. Even after my hard work of almost 2 hours of applying this protector on two different Vitas, there was still so many imperfections underneath the protector. Removing the two film backing while it adheres to the screen is such a major flaw imo, so many dust will fall... just look closely and use a flashlight if you already own this protector. The screen looks better without this protector on. The feel, middle line and collected dust outweighs the esthetic of ""invisible"" look of this protector.

Why?

Because the creators/publishers are paranoid about piracy --- so the game discs you are buying do not contain all the files needed to play the game.  In order to get these needed files, you need to download them from the creator's website on the internet.  On launch day, this was taking 4-8 hours to do.  In addition, after the files are downloaded, you need to register the game at the website before it will allow you to play it when you are not connected to the internet -- and that registration line can be long and slow!  And this is for the OFFLINE portion of the game, not the multiplayer portion.

The retail box apparently says ""internet connection required"".  They mean this folks -- NOT just for multiplayer!  You need to set aside several internet-connected hours in order to download the remaining files and register the game before you can play one second of it offline.

Booo!  Hiss!

But there weren't many shooters available for the PS4 at the time, so I decided to buy this along with the console.

It was a mistake, because the lag compensation still seemingly gives players with fast internet connections like me a disadvantage. Sometimes, I'm clearly playing against Japanese, Mexican, or Brazilian players, and they would just run around corners and kill me instantly before I barely have any chance to react. The game is simply frustrating and un-fun for this reason alone.

If that weren't bad enough, the game is just poorly designed overall, in so many respects. The maps are way too large and cluttered, and promote campers. And the weapons are extremely overpowered and kill almost instantly, again rewarding campers. The overpowered weapons also rewards noobs that can't aim, and simply resort to a ""spray-and-pray"" tactic of killing people, which works with surprising efficacy.

- Alienated millions of their once loyal fans (myself included)

I always enjoyed playing the campaign in the original starcraft/brood war and that's what I mainly purchased this game for.  Even though it's only the Terran's race campaign, it was long and pretty fun.  The achievements and different difficulties allow for some replay but only if you have access to the internet.

Your characters take little to no damage, do little to no damage against the monsters, then repeat the process.  One combat round of meaningless combat (grinding up materia... er lusche) takes a long time.  This is BORING!

The encounter level of the monsters is random.  You can easily fight against an impossible-to-run-from palette swap that one-shots your entire party in any area of the game.

If you buy their cheap/low end goods, you wind up with a pretty horrible product, whereas if you spend more money on one of their more expensive products, you usually get something great.
These headphones are definitely on their low end of things, and they fail to deliver. The 25$ you'll spend on these is 25$ too much. You will find you have wasted both money AND time ordering, waiting, and ultimately returning these.
Here are the ups and downs:
Pros: Almost none. The sound isn't completely horrible with these, but mind you, it's only passable. The cord is nice and long, and the remote built in to the cord is handy.
Cons: Horrible fit. These have a really poor ergonomic design, and I can't imagine them being comfortable for anyone. They feel as though they are constantly slipping off, and they provide poor ear coverage. There is nothing immersive about the sound or feel with these. The poor fit introduces pressure points on the ears and skull which quickly turn painful.
Normally, these comfort issues would prove problematic, except these headphones won't work long enough for you to worry about it. The microphone, I believe, has a manufacturing flaw which prevents a solid connection, rendering a staticy, unusable signal. The fact that the microphone is broken fresh out of the box is problematic. I experienced this on 2 different units. Occasionally it will work, only to quit working on a whim. I spent several hours tweaking system settings, only to realize and accept that the headphones were the sole problem, and that it was a manufacturing flaw.

If you have a Windows 8 computer and want to play GTAIV, I'll give you a piece of advice: don't. Personally, I thought getting Fallout 3 to run on a Windows 7 PC was a fairly daunting task, but getting GTAIV to work on a Windows 8 computer feels like a science project with a bit of voodoo magic thrown in. Here's how it went down:

Downloaded the game on and off for a few days.
Was unable to do anything because I needed to run it in compatibility mode.
Get the thing to install after a few hours of trial-and-error.
Attempt to launch the game.
SecuLauncher: failed to start application. [2000]
Found out I had to run it in compatibility mode AGAIN for the installed version.

I think it could have been so much better with just some minor tweaks. First of all, there's no challenge whatsoever in the career mode. Come in last place? No big deal...congratulations, you're onto the next race. It doesn't matter if you win or lose, you just keep progessing! It might be possible to beat the game without winning a single race! Also, Turn 10 is under the impression that gamers don't like grinding, but this just isn't true. Practically every race for the first few hours you get a new car for levelling up. The free cars just keep getting better. You can easily beat the game without ever buying a single car or a single upgrade! There's something disturbing about that. What's the point of playing the career at all? They might as well just give you the grand prize as soon as you turn on the system, and save you trouble of playing! Then the game gives out an absurd amount of credits and gives 100% discounts on upgrades after you've raced in a car a few races. I played the game maybe 40 hours and had easily purchased every single R1 car in the game. There was nothing more to keep playing for. Credits are useless. And 50 free cars is absurd; my garage is full of cars I've never even tried. I want to get used to a car for a couple of hours before I'm presented with another car. I really want to recognize the difference, which I can't do when I'm switching cars every race. Another gripe is the online mode. Turn 10 believes that gamers don't like ""ghost"" mode, where you can't slam into each other, but in earlier Forza's, when the matches were exclusively designed by players, everyone did ghosts. As it is, you have to hang back while everyone slams into each other in turn one and then you have a chance of actually winning as all of the cars slide off the course. Ghosts should be the primary user mode. Also, they set up a quickmatch option where there were no rules at all and you can bring whatever car you like, so of course the only car that can be competitive is an ""X"" level car. Also, if you win, everyone else gets to vote to kick you out, which should be re-thought really.

In terms of overall design, the model for simulation racing games should follow something Gran Turismo 4, in my opinion. You get a few credits to buy a piece of junk car, you get a few prize cars here and there, and never without a lot of effort, and you have to grind for a long time to get a good car. You can switch between special events, specific manufacturer events and core events whenever you like, and all of them seem meaningful. This will keep players playing longer. The ""economy"" in Forza 4 is a disaster. After 5 hours, you can be in the best cars in the game. After 30 hours, there's nothing more to work toward at all. Forza is trying to create a culture of ""you win no matter what"" and ""you're the greatest player ever no matter what"" but I think it will hurt the series in the long run. More grinding, give me something to keep working for.",Great Game with lots of design mistakes,1354147200,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The ending of Wind Waker was LEGENDARY! I yawned once I finished Twilight Princess.

Listen, this game had a wonderfull beginning. I liked the cutscenes and the first time I transformed into a wolf I was in awe. But then I hated how weak and rushed the plot became. Why the hell did those orcs just drop the kids somewhere? And around the time Ilia got her memory back the plot fizzled completely. Also the plot in this game was too little about Triforce, history, the world/land of Hyrule etc. They were touched really superficially.
The plot and dialogue were *extremely inferior* compared to Wind Waker.
Twilight Princess was boring, choppy and jumpy after a great beginning.

And the dungeons. Something was severely lacking. In the beginning they were ok, though nothing great, but then they got horrible. Like the City in the Sky and Twilight Realm. Horrible.
I guess they went for quantity not quality. The dungeons were boring and repetitive, the puzzles old and they lacked any atmosphere.
Also if I remember correctly in Wind Waker you had to use many of the items you had acquired in different places. Not here.

This game was also *WAY too easy*. I'm not a good player, honestly, but I never once died during the game. As a matter of fact I was near perfect health nearly all the time. Once you got the Master Sword you just needed to swing the nunchuk and the enemies would vanish. I mean I'd want standard enemies that would be at least as tough as Ganon was in the final swordfight.
The bosses were also very easy and somehow lamer than in Wind Waker.

I liked the Wii controls and they were well planned and easy to use. But I have one complaint. Circling behind an enemy's back really didn't work that well. First you had to sidestep and then roll. But guess what, most of the time the roll (+sidestep) brought you around the enemy to where you started. It was irritating (though not by any means impossible) to hit the enemies in the back.

Oh, and why did most of the characters have to look so retarded? They showed with some models that they could make neat looking ones as well...

Riding on the horse was the greatest part of this game!
You should really buy Wind Waker instead of this. People complain about the graphics but they're quite nice once you get used to them. And did I mention that the dialogue and plot are awesome.

I would even rather play an old NFL Gameday (Sony CEA) rather than this overrated pile. Back in 1997, Madden NFL 98 lost in sales to NFL Gameday 98 because it was inferior. The next year EA Sports improved and went back to being the #1 selling NFL game. Then in 1999, Sega Sports released the breakthrough NFL 2K which destroyed Madden NFL 2000 gameplay and graphics wise.

There's a raging debate on the net between fans of simulation racers like the Forza series versus arcade racers such as the excellent PGR series (or more recently Driver San-Francisco). I'm only going to rate this game on four factors which are important to me :-

#1. Sheer fun value.
#2. Visuals / Graphics engine.
#3. Crash / Physics engine.
#4. Pacing / Thrill / Driving on the edge-of-your-seat value.

For those 4 categories Forza Horizon achieves a 1 out of 5 IMHO!

GRAPHICS
I find it hard to believe the ex-Project Gotham Racing guys were involved with this game as it feels immature predating PGR3 / PGR4 by quite a margin. First off, the graphics do not feel current or next generation. Driver San Francisco destroys this game graphically! BTW: Driver-SF is flawed in its own way (see my review), but graphically its far superior. Whereas the Horizon physics engine feels incomplete even quite basic. Crash into a car head-on and the visual results are well... pathetic! A lot of other reviews have talked about the stupid in game gimmicks so I won't be redundant here, except to say the only thing I liked in this game was the in-car view.

SHEER THRILL
I primarily want to do a comparison between the more fun racing aspects of Driver-SF and PGR3 & PGR4. I play Forza 3 and Forza 4, and I'll openly admit that I'm not a huge fan of either, however, they both vastly surpass this effort. Forza 3 & 4 are closer to real-world racing for instance the FIA GT3 supercar series. But the fun value isn't there for me. I think video games should be slightly exaggerated and therefore the cars should have looser handling to capture the sheer thrill of racing! That's why I rate PGR and Driver-SF above the Forza series as the former are more fun IMHO.

OPEN-WORLD
Regarding open-world sandbox driving games, again Driver-SF kills this game stone-dead! Driver-SF is hugely ambitious and the game delivers a viable open-world. But Horizon doesn't feel like an open-world at all, it feels more like a Need-For-Speed imitation, albeit with better graphics perhaps!

ITALY / FRANCE
Overall the Driving genre desperately needs to be reinvented on the Xbox as its becoming staid. For instance, why are there no racing games based around Italian or French towns anymore...? Bring back and update the excellent handbrake racer 'GTI Club'.

IMDB: RONIN (1998)
I want a nail-biting racing game that feels as real as the DeNiro car chase in the 1998 movie 'Ronin'. The Forza series is not a patch on Driver-SF or PGR for that IMHO, but hey they're selling a ton of product so what do I know!",Skip!,1366848000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I was happy to pop this game in after buying from Amazon and everything I've seen to the end...wow.  Disappointment can only explain so much for me.

The AP system from mk2 was one of the many highlights of the series' battle system, challenging my strategic gland to new heights that left me satisfied in the end.  The removal of this in Victory was a bad idea, resulting in battles being more about mindless brawn than fluent brain tactics, not to mention that the game's bosses forces you to grind to ridiculous levels to take them down and eventually beat the game.  My party was around Level 90+ by the time I beat it, which to me is far too high of a level requirement to beat it.  Sure, there's DLC to increase your party's Level Cap, but that should've been there from the start.  The Scout system is also some of the most flawed mechanics I've seen in the RPG universe as paying them to reveal hidden dungeons, monsters, and items with a 50% chance turns the whole thing into a gambling game, making the Scout system are far worse alternative to spend your hard-earned gold on.  The story and character cast was also lacking (at least, compared to the first two games) in that the story is merely just ""Neptune goes into the past to meet more CPUs and kick more tail"" while the cast is mainly just CPUs without Compa or even IF (DLC don't count) nearby to join them on their quest to help shake up the variety.

There are plenty more problems I had with this game, but this is all I can explain in full without going overboard.  The only good things Victory did for me are having a notification mechanic alerting you to when you completed a Quest, as well as new clothing for Neptune, Noire, and Blanc.  Other than those, the bad outweighs the good for me and once I've gotten the normal ending, I just put the game back into its box and never bothered bringing it out again.",Disappointed,1519430400,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

In last year's version, if you fielded a good team, you could manipulate the audibles and the defense would react the same way every time.  If you needed 15 yards, you could get 20.  It got to the point where I would stop calling certain plays in the playbook because it was guaranteed to work every time.  That has been fixed this year but for several reasons, this game takes two steps back.

NCAA Football 2010 ushered in some unforgivable mistakes that sink this game all the way to complete mediocrity, such as fumbles when the other team needs the ball back, facemask penalties when they need a first down, and a completely idiotic camera angle which happens when you accidentally click the L3 button when trying to rush the quarterback (which happens to be the same button that moves your defensemen).  Once you click the button, if you don't click it again in time you end up off sides because down causes your player to move up and up causes the player to move down and if you're trying to blitz the quarterback, you're trying to figure this out before he snaps the ball because you're already off sides.  This happens to me about ten times a game, about half of which wind up in a penalty. I'm forced to play the other half from the idiotic camera view which is so worthless that I don't even play the down.

The worst of these miscues is easily the facemask.  I turned the facemask penalty slider as low as it would go and I still get flagged for it 4-8 times every game, usually on third and 10+ so the other team can get a first down.  The computer NEVER gets flagged for facemask, or any other penalties for that matter.  Penalties only apply to the user and not the AI.  This is unacceptable.  Also, if you try and play conservatively with the lead, yeah, you fumble the ball and the defense recovers.  I once had a 27 point lead in the 4th quarter when I fumbled the ball.  The defense returned for a touchdown, kicked off, I fumbled the return, the computer scored on the next play, recovered an onside kick, threw a bomb for a touchdown, RECOVERED ANOTHER ONSIDE KICK, and slowly drove down the field and scored with barely any time left on the clock.  I realize that EA needed to make this game more challenging, but there are better ways to do that than creating ways for the computer to cheat.  A couple of other maddening issues worthy of mention include tipped passes and defensive AI.  My tipped passes end up intercepted while the computer's float haphazardly into the hands of the intended receiver for a thirty yard gain.  They intercept nearly every mistake I make while my defense will drop three balls thrown straight to them on the same drive.  Also, the computer always makes defensive plays on the ball whereas you can try and swat or intercept the ball during the play and rarely does it ever work.  I'm beginning to think that these ""mistakes"" are intentional so that consumers will break the disc in half in a fit of rage and go buy another.  Seriously, how does this happen after twenty years of experience?

I learned my lesson with EA years ago.  They no longer get any of my money.  Every EA game I buy comes from Ebay or used from Amazon.  I also wait until I can get them for less than $20 so that I'm not pissed when I get ripped off like this.  Every year I read reviews just like this from people that continue to buy these mediocre games brand new.  As long as EA is raking in billions of dollars in sales, they won't care about the quality of the product.

UNEVEN AI. No matter how far in the lead you are or how perfectly you race, if you crash you'll fall down to 3rd or 4th, even in Easy races. But if you're a little behind, and you crash, it's virtually impossible to get back to the front even if you race perfectly. Bad balance and indecent rubber effect. This is so even on Easy races. Matter of fact, the difference between Easy, Medium, and Hard races is nearly unnoticeable after a while: they're all equally frustrating.

ABYSMAL MOST WANTED LIST MANAGEMENT. Three problems: (1) MW races are insanely difficult, which I suppose is good, but see above: the AI is just plain cheating. (2) When you win a race, you don't actually win the car! It is ""released into the world"" and you have to wait for it to ""appear"" near you and take it down to be able to drive it. That is really, really, really stupid. (3) When you eventually do get to drive a MW car, it may be hours after you won it, and by that time it's surely NOT the fastest available car. Even if you get to win it right away, chances are that by the time you've racked up enough speed points to challenge a MW list opponent, your current rig is already much faster (not that that helps you win MW races, even, given that the AI is a cheater). So why are we doing all this again? Literally the main goal of the game is useless.

IT'S NOT A RACING GAME. As others have said, this is basically Burnout with some NFS elements. There is very little ""racing"" and a lot of smashing and crashing. Let's leave aside, for the moment, that you crash on level geometry more than on actual obstacles. At least Burnout used to privilege good reflexes and creative trajectories, but in NFS:MW it feels like you win races by pure luck. Just try and try again until something happens that lets you win. That ""something"" may not even up to you to control, like the AI taken down by the cops, traffic that does or doesn't slam into you, etc. Sorry, but that's not racing. It's not even really playing, and you feel quite powerless.

ILLOGICAL OPEN WORLD DESIGN. (1) Not open enough. What's the point in having no invisible walls if there are constant checkpoints that dictate a route anyway?! Opportunities for creating new and inventive urban routes are wasted by having to abide by a completely arbitrary route, you constantly have to look to the map to know where you're supposed to turn, and if you miss a checkpoint you might as well restart the race. What is this, National Geographic Travel? (2) Too open. You don't have a garage, safehouse, or any place where to organize and display your car collection. In fact, you never really own cars at all, but just steal and drive them if and where you find them. Isn't that what GTA is for? (3) You can't start races when they're first introduced, but must drive to them. Yes, even if they're 10 miles away and it takes you 10 minutes of boring traffic-dodging to get there. Helloooo? Even RPGs have fast-travel systems!

COP CHASES ARE BORING. In the original 2005 Most Wanted, cop chases were tough to beat and escalated with heat level, but here they're easy, nail strips are clearly marked on the ground by yellow puffs of smoke (LOL! right), and there's no major difference between police cars (remember those cop Corvettes, armored SUVs, and helicopters? I had nightmares about those!). Moreover, two of MW's best features -- the cooldown hiding spots and the chase breakers -- have been partially or completely excised from this game.

COP CHASES ARE USELESS. If you escape you get ""speed points,"" which is fair enough... but forget about those million-dollar bounties from the 2005 Most Wanted, where a truly long and awesome escape basically bought you a new car: here, the points are meager and you feel like you worked for nothing. And if you're busted... get this... NOTHING HAPPENS TO YOU. Your car doesn't get impounded, you don't lose your speed points, you don't lose jack. In the 2005 MW being busted was reason enough to reload a previous save, but here you're just back to a jack zone like nothing happened. You even get speed points when you've been busted three or more times!! Talk about making games easier and more accessible to, you know, children.

LACKLUSTER CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS. Custom stuff is unlocked by placing in or winning races, which I suppose is fair, but all custom stuff is tied to the individual car. That means that whenever you get a new car, not only is it stock (as it should be), but most upgrades aren't even unlocked!! I don't know about you, but unlocking nitrous boost ten times is really boring. Also, remember all the cool custom shop decals and colors and rims and spoilers from 2005? Yeah forget about it. Here, you just drive through a mechanic shop that picks a random paint color for you. Yes, even in the middle of a race. And if you're being chased by the fuzz at that time, you hear them say things like ""suspect description is updated: the car is now orange."" I'm serious. I don't even want to talk about it. I'm still choke-laughing myself to death.

FRUSTRATING HUD. The idea of an in-game overhead menu is great, but it's very poorly realized. Everything is text-based, the game doesn't pause, and the menu options stay on the screen for five second tops, after which they're automatically hidden... which means that you can't even study the specs on your car and compare/contrast them with other cars' without having to exit and re-enter the menu at all times. That, plus the fact that there is NO GAME MAP (and, consequently, no GPS options) is 100% intolerable in 2013.

I just bought a PS3 after being an xbox 360 owner for years. Don't get me wrong I love my 360, but the PS3 price is in an OK range now, plus the Blue Ray, Wireless, free online play et all hooked me, not to mention the PS3 exclusives. I love my PS3.

Uncharted 2 was a huge hit, and I got uncharted 3 with my system, so I figured I'd get this game to play em in order. This game is a huge disappointment:

The pros:
Good story
Platforming (what little there is of it) is mildly amusing

The cons:
 - Jet Ski up rapids while getting raped by by dudes with guns, grenade launchers and exploding barrels, while FIGHTING the current, goes from fun, to tedious, to frustrating in about 10 seconds (seriously, you'll be thinking, ""Oh God, not that jet ski again"". If the jet ski portions were actually fun, they'd be a nice break, but as is, they're breaking up crap with a few crap sequences.

- Wave after wave after wave of enemies. On the surface this looks like an Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider genre game - well no, it's not, it's a freaking Gears of War clone. Gears of War was all about fighting waves of enemies, you expected it. This game  - jeeze - you'll kill off like  15 bad guys (and that takes a while, a long while) from behind cover and you'll think for a second that was fun now time to explore - NOPE - you'll hear a bad guy yell and another wave will hit, and you'll be pinned down fighting them off - then you'll do it one more time. There's a fine line between fun combat and GRIND, this game leaps over that line, you'll be GRINDING through bad guys thinking, ""Shouldn't I be doing some platforming?"" Usually if they just had one less wave it would be bearable, annoying, but bearable - as-is, it's just tedious, the combat ain't that great.

- What little platforming there is, isn't all that original, but compared to fighting wave after wave of bad guys you'll enjoy the five or six ledges you get to jump around on your way to the next 3 waves of bad guys.

- Later in the game, guys with one shot kills - they have laser sights - when you first meet them there is insufficient cover so they bum rush you. Seriously, who thought one hit kills was a good idea.

Graphics -
(A) Cut scenes - Can you say PS2? The cut scenes, (what drive the story) look like ass, like something from PS2, or XBOX
(B) Game - Graphics on backgrounds are nice, but get repetitive. I mean the jungle looks nice, but after about 20 minutes get's old.

End Boss - Anticlimactic quick time event let down. Lame ending, lame.

1.0,False,"09 2, 2007",A2MUACY8VTQV31,B00007KQC1,Kermit,"Despite teasing players with potentially intricate themes, such as political subterfuge, rebellion, and betrayal, the story - lynchpin of any great RPG - of Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter never strays too far from its premise. Where plots are generally uninteresting, it is left to the characters to enrich the experience by allowing players to identify with them through the course of their development. Unfortunately, beyond the fact that Ryu actually has a personality in this installment, the characterization is as shallow as a wading pool. Once each of the three characters has established their role (and you guessed it, there are only three), the story drags towards an uninspired conclusion...

Players will reach that ending in 15-20 hours, or perhaps twice that amount, depending on their tolerance for repetitive dungeon crawling and agonizing play mechanics. If innovation means taking traditional turn-based combat and throwing most of it out of a window, including all of its good qualities, then Dragon Quarter has accomplished just that.

The combat system is very limited. Ryu can only do sword attacks, none of which is anything spectacular; horizontal, vertical, and diagonal slashes, some enhanced by fancy effects, comprise his entire repertoire. Nina can only do magic; the usual arsenal of fire, ice, and lightning spells. Rin can only do gun attacks that with the exception of a few, all look the same, but have a variety of strategic effects.

Roaming bland dungeons and engaging in tedious battles comprises the whole of Dragon Quarter's gameplay. Still, there a few details that need to be mentioned. One of the defining elements of the Breath of Fire series is Ryu's ability to transform into a dragon. It is also often the most exciting part. Unfortunately, consistent with the rest of Dragon Quarter, that ability is watered down, unimpressive, and does very little to ease the player's suffering.

In terms of visuals, the game's objective seems to be adequacy, but never to venture as far as to be awe-inspiring. The character models are bland and, the animation isn't even noteworthy. The backgrounds are either sterile corridors reminiscent of hospitals, gritty metallic platforms, or at their best, lavish medieval-style halls. This lack of diversity creates a feeling of insufferable redundancy.

Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter is one of the most boring, trite, unfulfilling gameplay experiences in recent memory.

We finally got EA to talk to us and give us a new license for the software, about 6 weeks after buying it. They treated me as if I were clearly a software thief the whole time, which I really did not enjoy.

On the other hand, both my kids have enjoyed building creatures and watching them dance, sing, play. Of course the Creature Creator alone doesn't actually have a game - you just make creatures.

Top screen would not stay on the right top corner.  Note: For those who normally don't put the protector on their ds (like me), you may need one for the 3ds.  There is a mechanical problem with how the bottom screen raised edges actually can touch the top screen and scratch in two lines.

The technique for putting this on is okay but for me the simplier way they did it before worked much better.  I think my problem with the top adhesive is because of this new process.

Also note...the directions are not in order...very silly...the preparation before step 1 is actually at the end of the directions.  It basically says to clean the screen before you start but it still should be before step 1.

It didn't work then, and I don't think it works now. Traffic is still an issue which is enough to keep me from playing it. I've downrated the game to 1 star. I wish the game could have been as cool as it first looked to me. Maybe someday it will be.

Hello, many of you have probably heard about the terrible server issues this game had at launch. It has been nearly a week, and they are still ironing out those issues. I will use this space to focus on the game itself, rather than the problems its had with servers.

Over all the game is a blasts. The direction they are taking SimCity is really cool.

Maps are smaller, but you have to balance things more so you can't just build and build and build. Budget is smaller and things are more expensive, and monthly costs are also higher. So, as I said, you must balance everything carefully. The small map is not a bad thing when looking at it like this.

The buildings are modular, you can add on to them to make them more powerful, rather than having to place additional ones. This is pretty neat.

Roads are now what shape your city, rather than the grid-lines of previous games. Your zone density is linked to the roads, so you only have one type of zone for each of the residential, commercial and industrial. The higher density road capacity, the high density zone will develop.

Online multiplayer: it is a big part of the game, you basically can't get away from it. Even if you play a completely private game, where you play each city in your region, each city will still have to interact with the others in that region. Once you get to a certain point, cities need to share resources, citizens or other things. There is a great works feature in the region that all the cities can work towards. These are expensive and elaborate.

The online part does make for some frustration. If you hope to play whilst you travel on the train, or road, sadly you can not. Maxis/EA claims that this limitation, to always be connected to the internet, is so that their servers can do all the complex calculations so your computer doesn't have to. However, you'll probably notice at some point or another that you will lose connection, and yet you'll still be playing the game. This fact does make some people on the internet wonder if the always on feature is in fact DRM instead of the calculations mentioned. I don't know, and all I can confirm is that you will have to have your internet on if you want to play this game.

That said, all files are on EA servers, so you will not be able to reload if you make a bad choice or get a bad disaster.

I'm tired of typing, hopefully I've given you enough to think about. I really like the game, and as soon as they fix completely the server problems, I will have no issues with it.

Why do I care so much? This is a daily struggle for parents. The Family Timer allowed us to give our children the freedom to play the Xbox without fighting about it every day.

What does this mean for our family? We will set the same limits we had before, but now every time they play I will have to track it (makes my life worse), then when their time is up, I will have to fight with them about it. EVERY DAY.

Hmm, let me think about what that does to the XBox brand in my mind as a parent? Do I want my children to own more games? On this thing we fight about every day? NO! In fact I really wish I could just return the thing RIGHT NOW, given that we nearly only bought it so the kids could play Lego Dimensions, since all the reviews say the Xbox 360 version doesn't work.

The idea behind the action is wonderful.  Very interesting mixture of horror and science fiction.  No problem with that.  The problem is with the execution of the game in and of itself (I have an XBox 360, so those are the controls I used).

1.0,False,"03 24, 2008",A9LNWA25IM2DX,B000W91YTA,R.Suarez,"First of all I'd like to mention the fact that I owned the original Xbox for years until now, to me, it was the greatest video game console I have ever played (being a videogamer since the Atari 2600 times). It had great games (Battlefront, Ninja Gaiden, Prince of Persia trilogy, etc) and cool features and so far I had not even thought about moving to 360 since I still had pending games for the original Xbox. That changed when it was announced that Ninja Gaiden 2 would be released exclusively for the Xbox 360, me being a huge fan of the original Ninja Gaiden and given that Xbox games can be played by the Xbox 360 console, decided to sell my old unit and order the new 360 so I cold get Ninja Gaiden 2 when released on April.

I ordered from Amazon the console on January and it arrived on the 27th, everything seemed to be in place, I came to love Forza 2 and played a little my old games, I really didn't use the console that much since my newborn son wouldn't allow me to. Things started to go wrong when Ninja Gaiden's release date was moved from April to May, then from May to June. Amazon would do a great job informing me of the changes (as I had pre-ordered the game) and ask me if I still wanted to buy the item given the date change. I then decided to buy a 360 game to play and utilize the new features of my Xbox and I got Call of Duty 4. The game was terrific and I quickly became addict to it, I then started to use the console more often. About three weeks ago, I came home from the office and turned on the console, the disc tray made a strange noise and there seemed to be no disc on it as the dashboard had the `Open Tray' text in it, I was almost certain I hadn't removed the game so I checked, the game was indeed in the tray, the console would simply not recognize a disc in it. I tried CDs, DVDs and other games and got the same result, no disc was recognized at all and the tray made noises every time I opened/closed it.

The console had a warranty note asking you not to go back to the retailer in a case like this as they may not be `as well prepared as their technicians' and contact their support center instead. I did that and after waiting on the line for a while a person finally answered, I had to struggle with them as they could barely speak English, since I do speak Spanish I tried to make it easier for the guy, I don't know which part of south America they're from but even in Spanish I had a hard time understanding what he was saying and had the guy repeat almost everything he said. This person asked me to contact my supplier first and see if warranty applied (even though the warranty info on the box asks you to go to Microsoft first), the reason for that he said, was that the supplier could simply change the unit and provide me with a new one. He told me I could mail them my console to fix it, but if that were the case, it was likely that they would simply replace the disc drive with a used one, if the console need to be changed, they could mail me back a refurbished one at the risk of it being an older unit without the features of the one I purchased (of course, had I purchased their extended service contract they would `gladly' send me a new unit free of charge). After spending $349 in a videogame console and with only 1 month of use I found this unacceptable and could not believe a Microsoft representative would tell me that. I went into the Xbox 360 official website and was able to find document number 910798, which explained some potential resolutions to my problem (none of them mentioned by the rep I talked to on the phone), none of them worked and the last option was to submit the console for them to check it. While surfing on their site I found that there are so many users having this and so many other problems that made me wonder if I wanted to keep the console. After telling some of my friends of my experience I found out that most of the ones who own an Xbox 360 have had problems at some point and have had to mail them to be fixed (one of them has had to ship it three time already)

After all these problems I simply decided I did not want to keep the console, Amazon would accept the return after their 30-day return period but would refund an 80% of what I paid. So I shipped the unit back to them and am waiting for my refund. So far, what should have been a better gaming experience has cost me $70 I will not get from the return, $59 of a videogame I will not play anymore, $19 of a battery I had to buy for the control, $30 of the shipping charges and my old Xbox unit. You'd think that after paying all this money for their product you would expect quality (not only of the product but their service as well); to me this was nothing but a waste of my time and money.

I'd like to think I simply had bad luck but after reading in their own web site I can tell they are having lots of problems with these units, my dad who is a sales manager at a retailer store told me customers return these consoles all the time.

This sequel marks the end of Diablo series as we knew it. Unfortunately, not for the better. The game is generic and boring. Mainly due to oversimplification of the aspects that made prior games so successful, including character customization (skills and items) and story. The game immersion experience is as result poor and feels more like a fast paced combat or arcade game than a Role Playing Game.

Graphics
While updated and more subtle, graphics fail to offer visibility and immersion. This has been the struggle of game developers in the last decade or so to introduce the 3rd dimension, and too often, it was a failure. In Diablo III, you end having neither the visibility you had when in isometric 2d, or the immersion you would have in total 3d.
Additionally, the graphics are too cartoonish, cute and polished to provide the feeling you would expect in a dungeon crawling scary game. Diablo I and II were far more scary and offered enough `evidence' for your imagination to trigger visions of horrors.
In game cut scenes are an absolutely joke and seem to have been made for an arcade game from the 80's (only slightly exaggerating....), anyway,  not in line with the sprit of the prior games slow, terrifying, intense cut scenes.
Cinematics are as usual of the highest quality.

Music and sound
Music and sound effects are excellent, even if you will find some of the merit is low given most comes the original game.
Character voice: are you kidding me ? Just listen  to the female monk  and you will stop there.

Gameplay
That is where the disappointment is the largest: hardly any customization of character: we all follow the same blend generic skill progression path.

Immersion
None whatsoever. I feel absolutely not committed to my character whose development seems to be just following a script. Similarly, the story seems to be a generic repeat of prior games.
All (items, quests) seems to be delivered too fast for me to actually care of the objective or the outcome. The quests are delivered by an actor reading very fast the highlights of you will end up having to do. Yes, no more slowly unfolding mystery: you know pretty much all from the first moment. So complete lack of style from the art direction.
Items
This used to be the single point of unquestionable force of the prior versions gameplay. You are now overwhelmed with low quality items that hardly change anything to the gameplay: Diablo I and II were item based RPGs. It would make or break your character. Now, you have the choice every minute to change your items from lower quality to low quality. Blizzard went exactly the wrong way: they added even more varieties of the useless items. Of course, you can be sure that you will ultimately find some great items, but this may require some extra real money using the auction house done for this very purpose.

Server Dependency
So, there will be instances you are not able to play the game. And when you are, you may see all action suddently stopped. That's right: you are not in control, Battle net is. The final flaw that seals it all.

Conclusion: sadly have to recommend you go look for other games, especially for this type of money.  By the way if you have not noticed, I was and still am a huge fan of both Diablo I and II.",LOST IMMERSION and STYLE,1337385600,23,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

Gaming online since 1993 and this has been the worst playing multiplayer COD title due to the lag it just doesn't do this game justice. Think Rainbow six ""worst undedicated lag"".

***90% of the time head up battles are lost even if you get off the first 5 shots you get melted.
This will sit until it  gets fixed or I'm entirely done with the COD franchise.***

***The developer Michael Condrey confirmed it on reddit that it would have dedicated and has none. Maybe in the future but right now this game is a single player at best.***

Pros and cons I'll keep it simple.

First of all, the system has a 33% failure rate, according to retailers who have to deal with angry customers trying to return their broken Xbox 360s. That means that you have a 1 in 3 chance of your brand new Xbox 360 completely melting down within a year. Mine started malfunctioning after the first month. The Wii and PS3 both have failure rates of less than 1%. Congratulations, Microsoft!

Second of all, if you are a 14 year old boy who likes insulting people's mothers over a headset, skip this paragraph. If you're not, then perhaps you don't like to play sports games or first-person shooters with 14 year olds over Xbox Live. I don't, and therefore I have nothing to play on the Xbox 360. This, aside from the malfunctioning, prompted me to sell mine in favor of a Wii. The only games I wanted to play on the Xbox 360, Ninja Gaiden and The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, are both available on better systems.

Also, parents, please don't think that I'm suggesting that this system is actually good for teenagers. While it is designed for 14 year old boys by men with 14 year old minds, the online gaming community would make most adults blush with its anger, profanity, and hatred laced dialogues.

I understand that Microsoft has a ""vision"" of a new generation of online gamers, and that they are catering to this market. The problem with this, is that online gamers are, generally, idiots. I've got several years of experience wading through their shallow world. I finally decided not to play any games online any more for the same reason that I don't go hang out at the local high school.

Why:
You enjoyed the heck outta DMC 2 and DMC 3, need more of the same, and dig the fashion designs.

Why not:
It's a slow, repetitive, uninspired ""button-masher"" as my friend would say (a game where you triumph not by skillful maneuvers or clever strategy, but by simply punching the attach button allot). The first DMC was a masterpiece of dark, creepy, Gothic horror with heart-pounding action and white-knuckle tension. It was fun to play and cool to watch. It was very empowering.
The second DMC was worthless but the third was somewhat OK. And again, in this fourth one, you just just run around what looks like a European tourist village and shoot/chop seemingly endless legions of monsters that aren't in the least intimidating (rag dolls and marionettes) that just pop up out of the floor until the game decides you've killed enough and lets you continue to the next mindless melee.
DMC 4 has none of the edge of the first and third. It's like it's trying to be it's own game, which is not why we buy it.
The movement is unnatural and the camera is maddening.
The story is uninteresting.
The sound effects are stock.
The objectives are all too often unclear.
It fails to make use of a fraction of the PS3's awesome power. It looks like a PS2 game.

Notes:
After a week, both my son and I gave up on it, dusted off the PS2 and played 1 and 3 again.

Putting that aside, though ... very little thought went into this game. Ostensibly this game is vaguely based on the cartoon ""Scaredy Cat,"" in which Porky Pig and Sylvester spend the night in a house Porky doesn't realize is haunted. The first level is spent in a spooky woods full of ghosts, which fits the theme; then the second level is set in the Old West. Well then.

Porky responds to the controls poorly. In most of the Acclaim Warner Brothers games the problem was too much character fidelity; they were so worried about making the characters move like cartoons that the animations were allowed to get in the way of gameplay. F'rexample, in Death Valley Rally the Road Runner stands up stiff-straight when still and leans forward horizontally when moving, making it very difficult to judge where the Road Runner would end up when you moved the D-pad. Here, though, Porky is constantly making weird faces and his movement is slow and choppy. It feels like he's moving through treacle and the animation doesn't look anything like it should. I'd say the code wasn't optimized, but I can't imagine even Acclaim letting a game out the door without that.

The level design is essentially random. In the first stage, lots of platforms lead nowhere; frequently the only way to advance is to fall into a pit and wander around until Porky finds a spot where Daffy will scream at him and cause him to jump to the next section of the game. Enemies are either easily avoided or impossible to avoid; one long section that might have offered some challenge can be completely skipped just by bouncing off the head of a nearby flying enemy. Another section consists of ascending and descending a tree trunk (in terribly done Mode7) with one mistake jumping between the minuscule platforms sending you falling WAY down.

The first boss is not animated. I don't mean ""is poorly animated."" It has only a handful of frames and jumps back and forth between them like the old LCD games, and throws white McDonalds logos at you. Depending on whether it randomly throws them low or high the boss is either pathetically easy or unreasonably difficult.

The next level is a Western, as noted, and Porky simply runs from left to right through a ghost town. It's hard to tell what's a platform and what's not and frequently impossible to avoid taking a hit from the enemy.

I was a little over an hour into the game when I permanently entombed it in its fancy holographic sleeve. In the brief amount of time that I have lost while playing this game, it is readily apparent that this game is a Silent Hill/Resident Evil wanna-be. Maybe the game gets better with time, but I doubt it; having played games for decades, one gets a sense for this sort of thing.

The story is obtuse, hackneyed and slow. OH GNOEZ THIS IS NO ORDINARY POLICE CALL. The first chapter you spend mostly asking yourself ""what is happening"" and limping. Oh goodness, the limping. I think I limped for four minutes straight down some poorly-realized sewer tunnel. Then comes the sneaking around the chainsaw guy who, if he spots you, runs you down and insta-kills you. Ripley, hide in a locker! Quick, find a bottle! Has this kind of thing not been done already? Did I see the Assassin's Creed guy? What is even going on?

Chapter two puts you in Resident Evil 5 mode. Here is a gun and a big lantern that you somehow hang from your belt. Dangle, dangle. Do not mind me, while I try to sneak with this dangling gas lantern; I just want to stick this knife in you. Nothing novel here and nothing scary, really. The only ""survival horror"" aspect I experienced was setting off a trip-wire that I was two feet away from immediately after coming out of a cut-scene. SURPRISE, YOU'VE BEEN HORROR'D. I was horrified that I had spent money on this game.

The game feels very hodgepodge. It also feels generic, arbitrary and amateur. I did not find the game engaging and subsequently cannot suffer the eccentric quirks it appears to be revealing. Everyone will have a different criteria for enjoyment, but what is the point of playing a video game that does not meet that criteria?

Maybe I will use my one remaining match to set the game on fire so it does not come back to kill me later as I ineffectually swing at it with my marshmallow fists.

I love the Idea of the 18 Wheels of Steel series, but over all, it is poorly executed.  First, there is no tutorial.  This would have greatly increased the accessibility of the game, however, you are just thrown in and expected to learn only from experience.  Also, Pedal to the Metal incorporated a reputation feature that made you work your way up.  This game lacks that completely, therefore you can haul whatever, whenever - taking away from the ""risk-reward"" feeling of the game.  The graphics are bad.  The physics of the trucks are ok, but everything else is rather cheap.

This games is really, too simple.  And why the heck is this considered a sim?  At best, it's a strategy game.  All you control is speed, steering, fuel, and sleep.

Off the bat, you simply shoot the same looking monsters over and over again. No pacing whatsoever! The storyline is laughable. Its amazing game devs thought this was worth the cash. They really are robbing the gaming industry and killing it at the same time, which is some feat I have to say!

Theres no cutscenes whatsoever to break up the action! A typical level in Doom is simply shoot shoot shoot jump, shoot, collect health, shoot again.

1.0,True,"03 3, 2012",A331U01T7DMMHP,B003G2Z4FK,Davidovich53,"This controller worked great - at first.  Now it keeps turning itself off every 2 seconds.  It's been rendered unusable.  And before anyone asks, no I didn't drop it, throw it, slam it, get it wet, or expose it to harsh conditions.

I'm now forced to go back to the default Sony controller, which is what I was trying to get away from in the first place.  The Nyko controller worked fine for about six months, and now it's ""bricked"" itself.  I know this controller was an aftermarket, ""budget"" product, but was I wrong to expect more from a manufacturer in the year 2012?

My original review is as follows:
The primary features on this controller are the L2/R2 buttons which give you just enough resistance to feel ""right"" when being pressed.  And they're in a concave shape (like the 360's controller) which prevent your fingers from accidentally slipping off.  If you're anything like me, you probably can't stand the mushy, imprecise, slippage-prone L2 and R2 buttons of the default Sony controller.

The ""rightness"" also applies to the face buttons and select/start buttons, which feel springy and deliver a nice popping feel, giving good feedback with every press.  The body of the controller itself is ever so slightly bigger than Sony's, which allows for a more comfortable, natural-feeling grip.

However, the L1 and R1 buttons by contrast feel flimsy.  The R1 button in particular has a tendency to get stuck in the ""pressed"" position, which actually does NOT affect performance: even when the button is stuck, my onscreen character doesn't actually fire his gun.  When I actually tap the button (in its stuck position), the added pressure on the button actually makes my guy fire.  This took a little time to get used to, but now I hardly notice it.

Clicking the thumbsticks (the L3 and R3 functions) takes a lot more effort than on Sony's controller; you have to really, REALLY press hard to make them click.  After using the thumbsticks for a few days, though, it's become somewhat easier.  Same with the D-pad; you have to press down hard for the movement to register.  Tilting the sticks to move my character/pan the camera also takes some adjustment; in testing out this controller on Saints Row 3, I had to turn my camera sensitivity way down because it was simply too fast.  Most games allow you to adjust camera sensitivity, so this isn't too big of an issue.

The fact this controller is wired may be a negative to some, but for me it's a positive because I don't have to keep buying batteries.  Another big drawback is that you can't use the ""home"" button on the controller to turn on your PS3; you have to hit the physical power button on your PS3, then hit the home button on the controller to sync it to the system.  Yes, you have to do this EVERY time you turn on your PS3.  It's a very minor step, but if your couch is very far away from your PS3, this could get annoying.  The controller has a nine-foot cable, with a Velcro strap to keep the cable rolled up if you don't need the entire nine feet (and let's face it, who would actually need all NINE feet?).

Perhaps the biggest drawback is that this controller does NOT have SixAxis controls.  You read that right: if you want to play Heavy Rain or Flower, break out the default controller.

I hope this review is useful (if a bit long!), with both the pros and the cons.  Overall I'm very happy with this controller, especially for only 13 dollars, as what was only supposed to be a second controller has now become my primary one.","Updated review, 11/9/12",1330732800,7,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},

When I say the dialogue is meaningless, I mean that the scenarios will play out almost identically if you replay the game and choose different dialogue. Some of your actions alter the course of the game, but only slightly as far as I can tell.

Also, the way the save points are set up, if you get stuck and keep dying on a certain part and want to back up and try it again, you have to do the exact same scene over and over and over again until you figure it out. It's so boring that it makes the game almost unplayable to me.

But the creators of this game loss many stars for erasing all the credits one earns during the game and all you did, earned, accomplished is forgotten; meaning I could not upgrade the weapons for the other allies during another play through.  And if I ever decided to play it on a harder level my weapons would be just as wimpy as my very first game instead of all the upgrades I went through to strengthen and create a more powerful weapon which would have made playing at a harder level a tad easier.  If not for that screw-up and a few others, I would have gladly given it 5 stars.  Because the game strips away everything, it creates a barrier against playing it again.

All the characters were great but one and it happened to be the main character.  For starters, he's cross-eyed with a small head, arms as thick as his legs and his face reminds me more of a reptile than a male protagonist.  They tried to copy the Nathan Drake character from the hugely popular Uncharted series and failed. Instead you end up with a freakish appearing persona which I did not like in the least.  I would have greatly preferred his friend Bo or Charlie to have been the protagonist of the story.  They looked more like men than a badly put together human being.  I wish he would have been the one who turned out to be a robot so that the rest of the crew could have laid him to rest...permanently.  He appeared to be an inbred or a genetically fouled experiment.  Even the robot Cain had more personality than this guy.

Say you played the entire campaign once...maybe twice.  And one day you pick the game up and instead of going through the entire campaign again, you decide to just play certain chapters to concentate on certain characters in order to unlock the trust trophy associated with one of your allies. Say, you play for an hour or two and you quit, it saves and you think nothing of it.  Well, here's the bad news, I did just that and the next day when I pressed ""continue,"" instead of taking me back where I left off a day prior, it took me back to the last save of the full campaign--which was the last boss fight.  What miscreant thought up this post game menu of miserable choices that do not save data?  This game is not as great as I thought it was.  How can you select a chapter and it won't be saved--what's the point in playing it if you can't come back and pick up where you left off.

This game is definitely a one time play and it's not worth picking up until it's $10 or less new or used. For that I'm taking another 2 stars and it's got only one now.

1.0,False,"01 28, 2007",A304GUEPCPYM3Z,B000B43OY4,citan-uzuki,"There is absolutely no doubt that this is a Microsoft product.  It comes out of the factory full of defects.  The customer buys the product, takes it home, and discovers the problem.  The said customer calls for support.  Microsoft's first reaction is to try to put the blame on the customer.  After all, it surely must be the customer's fault that they're having problems.  Besides, to readily acknowledge a problem might mean more corporate money would have to be redirected to solving the issue.  The customer, like most people, politely and patiently persists and Microsoft finally listens and agrees to fix the problem.  And Microsoft's solution is not always the best possible, in terms of what is good for the customer.  Eventually, the boys from Washington wakes up and decides that they do indeed have a problem with their product.  And then they reluctantly put away the latest copy of WIRED magazine and get to work looking for ways to patch the problem.

So now you say, ""Hold on Citan.  I'm looking to buy a console, not one of the Windows Operating Systems.  What are you doin' writing a Windows review here.  Please, I'm begging you.  Tell me about the XBox 360!  And please, make it quick before the boss walks in and sees me surfing the net instead of doing his work.""

My friend, I hate to break the news to you but I am indeed writing a review of the XBox 360!  And you know, brevity is not one of Citan's traits.  But I am sensitive to the fact that you might be reading this while you're at work and are risking the wrath of your boss.  So let me respond to the Big Question, now.

Do I recommend the XBox 360?  No, not for the average gamer.  The hassle and aggravation that would result due to the console's high potential for breaking down are just not worth it.  Not for the average gamer.  You see, the average gamer is not extremely particular.  The typical gamer can find many games, from several different genre, that they can enjoy.  So, unless you are compelled to play Gears of War or any of the XB360 exclusive titles, my recommendation is to stay away from this console.  At least for now.  Who knows, the console might eventually become reliable after Microsoft applies a few more ""patches"" to the problems that plague their console.  But don't hold your breath.  Do keep this in mind.  Microsoft is still patching up Windows XP, for Pete's sakes!

A new, redesigned version of the console will be released later this year.  And that version will use a cooler-operating processor that should help alleviate one of the 360's main issues: overheating.  It will also have a larger HD.  I recommend that you wait until then to make your purchase.

Well, I am an optimists.  I can find humor under circumstances that would make the average person suffer a coronary.  This is a quality that helps me cope with my work, as a computer technician and a part-time public school teacher.  I knew before buying the 360 that the potential for hardware failure was very high.  Much higher than just about any consumer electronics product out in the market right now.  But, I am surprised that my brand new console lasted only one month!

I rarely played games off of my 360's disk drive .  Mainly because I do not care for First-Person Shooters.  But I do download a lot of movies and television shows for viewing.  I also play a lot of arcade games.  Basically, my console has had gentle treatment.  One day, two weeks ago, my console started to lock/freeze up.  The picture on the screen was distorted.  It happened while downloading a movie.  I called Microsoft and ofcourse, got the Standard Response: ""Overheating usually happens because the customer fails to provide adequate ventilation"".  I then told them that mine is out in the open, on a wire rack.  Ventilation ain't the issue, Louie (the Microsoft Tech's name).  So the tech agrees to send a shipping box.  I was instructed to remove the HD and the faceplate.  I would be getting a refurbished unit, most likely.  I asked to be transferred to Live support, so I can get my spent points back.  The lady on the other end refused to give me back my points, at first.  Even though my purchased movie failed to download due to their crappy console.  She said it was against their policy to give back points until the customer receives his replacement console.  I asked if they will automatically credit them back once the replacement arrives.  She said ""no"", I would have to call again and request them again.  I refused to end the call and she finally agreed to give them back to me.

I talked this over with my fellow computer techs.  Their advise was to ask the retailer for an exchange.  That way, I get a brand new console instead of a refurbished unit.  Besides, there are many customers who got their refurbished replacement and it did not work right out of the box.  Thankfully, I made the console purchase from here, Amazon.  Amazon customer service apologized for my troubles and agreed to ship me a brand new replacement.  It should arrive later this week.  All I can say is that Amazon customer service is awesome.  Thank you, Amazon.

I had heard numerous issues with the console prior to purchase.  I knew that where there is smoke, there is fire.  But I am accustomed to dealing with hardware issues.  I receive, and make, a lot of technical support calls.  So this is normal for me.  But it may not be to you.  If you dread such things, then stay away from this console.  If you're comfortable with it, then that's fine.

Are you buying for your children?  If so, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  Consider this scenario.  It's Saturday, you're looking forward to a relaxing day at home.  And then your child runs up to you in a state of total panic.  Being the good parent that you are, alarm bells suddenly go off in your head and you begin to inspect your child for possible signs of injury.  The child finally tells you that his brand new XBox 360 has broken down, right in the middle of his/her game!  Your jaw drops.  After you recover from your brief WTF moment, you agree to call Tech Support.  After the obligatory Q&A, they agree to send you a shipment box, for the console's return to them.  And then they agree to send you a refurbished unit for replacement.  And now, you wait patiently.  YOU, wait patiently.  Meanwhile, five times everyday, you get the following refrain (sort of like what the raven says in that famous poem!) from your precious child, ""Is it here yet?""

All joking aside, if you simply must play the games that are exclusive to the 360, then make the purchase.  But do so from a retailer that would allow you to exchange the unit, when it fails.  Not all retailers will, according to Microsoft.

Do I regret my purchase?  Not yet.  Thanks to Amazon's great customer service.  Also, I have the patience of Job.  I also have other consoles to use while waiting for the replacement.  And being a technician, I am used to dealing with technical issues.

There is one other important lesson that I learned from this situation.  You see, one week after getting my console, I wrote a nice review of the console.  I gave it 5 stars for fun and a 3 stars for the overall.  Five stars for fun, because I liked being able to download movies and shows.  Three stars overall, for the console's potential reliability and build quality.  I would like to revise those ratings now.  And I will explain my reasons for lowering the fun rating.  The overall rating decrease should be obvious.  So what did Citan learn?  Basically, you cannot own a video game console for only one week and write an accurate review of its potential quality and reliability.  One week's experience is not enough.  I learned that.  I have now experienced those ""anecdotal"" problems that others have mentioned for myself.  That makes them more real, and not just someone's words.  On the same line of thought, I also did not want to rewrite the review on the same day of the problem.  Fairness, to me, to the XBox, and to you is important.

I realize that the best way for me to get a lot of ""helpful"" points is to give the product a 5-star rating.  Giving this product, or basically any product, a low rating guarantees me a lot of ""unhelpful"" points.  You see, a lot of people who are reading these reviews are the so-called supporters of the console.  A lot of readers already made the investment and are just curious as to what others are saying about their baby.  And you've got people who have made up their minds and are just saving up for the big purchase.  They do not like to see low ratings for their chosen console.  But that is fine.  They no longer need the review.  You see, reviews are written for people who have not made up their minds.  Reviews are written as a service for the people who are still doing research. I can only hope that no one bought the console based on my original review.

I lowered the fun rating because the hard drive is much too small for its intended purpose.  And honestly, a product's reliability will affect how fun it will be to own.  And unlike Windows, there are atleast two other alternatives to this product that are worthy of consideration.

UPDATE 3/25

It's been confirmed that a newer version of the console will be released in April.  It will have a 120gig HD, and HDMI output.  It will also come in black color.  My advice to you, if you are set on purchasing a 360, is to hold off and wait for the new version.  You see, I really do not believe that the problems with the current console have been corrected.  Plus, the upcoming version will be a much better value.",Typical Microsoft Product,1169942400,5,{'Edition:': ' Pro Console 20GB'},

Strangely, this is not what ruined the game for me. It was the arbitrary soul tendency system, which IS the most cryptic pile of nonsense I have ever run across in a game. I got to hand it to the people who marketed Demon's Souls, they decide to call it an old school hardcore gaming experience, and critics and gamers buy it. That's the reason I bought it. But those old games were hard because of a lack of game testing or technological limitations. This game was probably not tested very much, or at all. It would go a long way in explaining the shizbomb story, and lack of character development.

It seemed cartoonish, with lackluster graphics, so-so weapons, and a floaty, sluggish feel to game play.  Somehow this combination of elements fostered an unimaginable allegiance and love for this game that I just don't understand and probably never will.

The gameplay is mediocre. Running seems slow and awkward, rather than speedy and fluid. The gunfire is interesting - the weapons really kick, so aiming is more realistic. Otherwise SOF plays just about like any other first person shooter.
This game is touted for its ""realistic"" weapons damage. Hitting different parts of enemies' bodies results in different body parts being blown off.

The game ended in a big disappointment. In Cod4 multiplayer games, I always get 1-3 in place every match so you can say that I don't suck at fps, but this game just gave some high blood pressure problem throughout the gameplay. A lot of stuff is unreasonable.

AI is stupid. Your team can barely hit anyone, but the enemy can pretty much snipe you with a handgun over 50 feet and more. Your team doesn't do crap, one time the enemy walked up to one of my guy and they both just stood there. And you can never tell where you're being shot at, so forget it if you get shot once, you'll be dead before you find them. There is also no timeline sort of thing where your military higher-up goes ""forward!"", and the battle will go on as long as it has to (the flood of the enemies will just come not stop), unless you risk yourself and go forward----only then your teammates will actually forward and story goes on (for the most part anyways).

Anyways, there is a lot of bullcrap like many other reviewers stated, and I as well ended up cursing, shouting, and scratching my head throughout the gameplay. Don't buy this game if you don't the patience because this game isn't quick-and-clean fast paced fps game like cod4 is.

I live on a college campus, and sending mail out is a struggle, especially when you have no car and the nearest post office is pretty far away. I contacted Turtle Beach about an issue with this headset playing an extremely high pitched noise when I try to use the headset for skype. It was determined that the amp box provided with the headset was the issue. Yet, they want me to send back both the amp and the headset. Why would I bother returning the headset when I've already made it clear that the headset has no issues whatsoever, and it's the amp? The e-mail back from their support was very hostile and they were completely intolerable of my situation, and they've made it nothing but a hassle to handle this situation. I will never buy from turtle beach again.

Onto the headphones, I've been using these for a few weeks now. Honestly, I really don't like them. When plugged into the amp box, there's constant feedback that varies in severity, and it honestly hasn't shown much improvement to the sound quality (other than a tiny bit of bass, and I personally don't care much about bass). Setting up the amp for a desktop PC was incredibly frustrating.

These headphones sure as hell aren't worth their price, and the amp is utterly useless. My Logitech H540 headphones (a very very simple $40-ish pair of headphones, but have never failed me) work just as good as this pair. A pair that's supposed to be higher quality for gaming.

I am a long time 2K fan, but what I really liked is when they started the my career mode. I have found a lot that I really don't like. Keep in mind I am only reviewing the my career section of the game.

Let me start with what everyone is complaining about. The VC! This game has turned into a money grabbing nightmare. Just the micro transactions alone ruin the game in my opinion. Sure you can earn it through play, but it takes a long time and you just don't make enough from game to game to make it worth it spending on anything besides player attributes.

Over emphasis on signature skills. This one is really agitating. I had an athletic center, 7th 2inchs, max vertical, and maxed out blocking and struggle to average 1 block a game. Add eraser and chase down artist and suddenly I was averaging 5.6 blocks a game. To me this is bs. They should place more emphasis on the players timing than making them use a ton of VC to get something that just makes their character react how he should in the first place being he's in the NBA. If this was high school basketball, okay cool.

That leads into a whole other problem. How terrible they start your career player at. You can't make a layup,  run down the court, dunk at 7ft 2in or pass, dribble or rebound. You are useless and belong at a grocery store, not on a basketball court. That coupled with the horrible attempt at a story line that also ruins the experience in and of itself. No words can express how miserable it is. You feel like you playing someone else's save with the stupid junk your player does and says.

Next we have position bias. Yes, if you are a center or a power forward,  you are automatically and are huge disadvantage. Both post positions are automatically cut out in the opening cut scene where your character is clearly a guard. Unfortunately that cut scene is what the rest of the game is like. Your 7ft 2 center will, post up for threes instead of roll to the basket on a pic and roll, spin layup, refuse to dunk under the basket. Miss post shots, but somehow knockdown jumpers? Furthermore, guards will out rebound you. My center was on the Timberwolves,  Rubio would out rebound me nearly every time we went head to head. This was also true with,  Tony Parker,  derrick rose, rajon rondo, jru holiday, and Daron Williams to name a few. In fact my center only averaged 6 rebounds a game! That's even with all the stats maxed out and all the signature skills for rebounding. So I made a 7ft small forward with the same signature skills as a test. Sure enough,  I know average 10 rebounds and 4 blocks (block stat maxed ar 75!) a game. I out rebound other centers and power forwards. This is really sad, being the small forwards rebound and block stats max out way lower than the centers do. It's obvious this game was made for people who wanted to be sf/sg/pg positions.

Lastly, the lack of actual basketball in the game. The AI for team mates is abysmal. There is no give and go, no pick and roll (your player actually freezes until the defender gets back on you), they never allyoop you or get you shots you can actually take. They throw you the ball and you are on your own. No one makes cuts, no one sets picks. It's obviously set up for someone to waltz down the lane and make lay up, or even more likely,  launch 3s.

With two factors that alone make this a one star, the VC/Micro transactions and the horrible attempt at a story line make this such a let down. If you like the simulation aspects to this game series, you'll be satisfied.

The controls aren't well designed, partly because the game is mainly set in 2-D, but is also 3-D whenever it is most inconvenient. You are controlling a fleet of ships, but the controls aren't up to the task of controlling individual ships (which is frequently necessary). Commands to individual ships are often mysteriously forgotten. The A.I. for both the enemies and your own ships is quite poor. Tedious micromanaging is the norm.

The main voice acting is merely decent, while the secondary voice acting is dreadful due in no small part to muddled accents (father was Russian and mother was Scottish?). Even worse, dialog during combat is actively misleading with lines such as ""shields are down, captain!"" when all ships' shields are actually fine.

The space battles are dull affairs as you have so little control over the single ship you are managing at any given moment. On top of that, there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to the effectiveness of the weapons and shields. On many occasions I've found it necessary to retreat from an enemy who had hammered my ships, only to repair and return and find that same enemy is suddenly ridiculously weak and easy to destory.

Even at the ""easy"" setting, the difficulty of this game has nothing to do with the actual gameplay and everything to do with the how well or how poorly the mission is crafted to the controls and how random are the spawned enemy (be they ships, or asteroids, or even timed events). More than one mission (and you cannot skip a mission) is nothing more than tedious hours of repeating the mission until you are lucky enough to overcome the objectives.

Hopefully, you will stumble upon this  review.  I am going to give a non-biased review (for the fist part)that  will give viewers something to think about when investigating which new  system they will buy:  DC (Dreamcast) or the playstation2, or wait awhile  for new technology.......  My own thoughts and opinions are at the end.
So, here's part 1:  Amazon.com doesn't give the complete specs and  information for either of these competitors.  When choosing a system,it all  comes down to pure horsepower, and of course, the games.  The Sega  Dreamcast is looking good, with a 200MHz, 128bit central processor,  compared to PlayStation2's precise 294.912MHz, 128bit CPU. Sony is  promising 32Mb of memory, plus 4Mb of video memory for the picture and 2Mb  dedicated to sound effects and music. Sega on the other hand has already  bundled 16Mb of main memory, 8Mb of video RAM and, likewise, 2Mb of sound  memory (with a Yamaha sound card, which is a big plus). Due to the  Dreamcast's 16mb of main memory, it is hard to convert PC games to  Dreamcast.  But, PlayStation2's video memory isn't that great, which could  limit high-resolution textures and image complexity.
In plain old  english, they both are almost equal in how the games will run (they'll run  great), but the way the memory is divied up is different.  But what  about the games?  Dreamcast has a lead over the playstation2 system with  many more games because of it's earlier release date.  On the other hand,  the playstation2 can play old playstation games (which won't use the full  playstation2 capacity).  I would have to say that in time the playstation2  will have more games, just look at the HUGE slew of games the playstation  has now.  On the other hand, many of sega's games have gotten fabulous  reviews, meaning that although sega probably won't release as many titles  compared to playstation2, the games that they will release will be great,  just look at Soul Calibur for example, or Crazy Taxi.
The ""extras  and freebies"" on a system also influence many buyers.  The dreamcast  homes a 56k internal modem which will allow users to play games such as the  upcoming titles NBA and NFL 2K1 (not to be confused with NBA and NFL 2k)  and Quake3 over the internet.  The Playstation2 though, will allow buyers  to watch DVDs on the system. Playstation will release a modem for the  system in the future.  Well, there you have it, good old complete  specs.
  Part 2:  now for my personal opinions.  I myself, investigated  both systems VERY carefully.......and decided to go with the Dreamcast  system over the playstation2.  Yes, you read correctly, the Dreamcast over  the Playstation2.  By now you're thinking, ""why would anyone do such a  thing? ""  There are several reasons.  One:  The dreamcast utilizes the  modem right from the get-go, while the playstation2 won't be giving users  the opportunity to use it for awhile, and Sony has not yet given detail to  when it will be able to be used.  Thus, one of the Playstation2's  ""freebies"" is going to be useless for some time.  Two:  DVD?  Didn't Sony realize that a measely 4mb of video memory just won't do it for  DVD's?  You need much more memory and a higher processor speed to run DVD's  smoothly on a system like such.  For example, to run DVD's very smoothly on  a computer would require 500 mghz plus 16 mb of video memory, or even more.  True, you can run it on 300 mghz and it will run well, but with that  amount of video memory the picture would be terrible, which defeats the  purpose of DVD's.  Thus, both of the Playstation2's freebies are worthless  (or for some period of time when dealing with the modem).  Three:  The  sound processor is mediocre to sub-par on the Playstion2, where as the  Yamaha processor on the dreamcast is a fine piece of hardware.  And lastly,  Four:  a small but VERY annoing querk, the Playstaion2 has only 2  controller slots!  The DreamCast has 4, supporting small parties and get  togethers with friends.
All in all, I personally think the Dreamcast,  with its great hardware specs and head start with it's amount of game  titles is a better buy.  And it's 100 bucks cheaper.  Now, I'm sure MANY  people will disagree with me in the second part of the review, but no one  can disagree with me on the plain old specs in the first part.  So, please  readers, keep this in mind when making your decision.  Thank you.",The Big Fight:  DreamCast or Playstation2,964569600,197,,

The economy is so inflated due to only being able to post 10 items every 3 days on the auction house. THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL DESIGN. Blizzard wants to encourage people not to play their game legitimately rather than spend their money in the RMAH buying items.

UPDATE MARCH 4TH, 2012

This is the first time I do an update on a review and the reason it's very simple, the idea behind this product it's good, but the design it's just wrong, after checking the temperature on my PS3 after playing 5 hours straight using this product, it was boiling hot, the back of my PS3 was extremely hot, so I decided to unplugged the ""cooler"". On a different day I played for another 5 straight hours with out the cooler, and the PS3 was warm, not hot as the day before. On both occasions I've had the PS3 on top of a laptop cooler, and the entertainment center is open on the back and front, so there's a good flow of air. I guess this product would be better if it had larger and faster fans like the modifications on the picture.

So my recommendation it's to place the PS3 on top of a laptop cooler, this gives a good flow of air to the intakes on the PS3, and also have it in a well ventilated area. My first PS3, 80 gig fat, lasted almost four years, and I used it for everything, now this one I just use for video games., so it should last a while longer than the first.",NOT GOOD AFTER A WHILE,1329004800,,,

This is a decent flight combination and I enjoyed this, at least up until June of 2014. When the control stick is drawn to the right, the control throws itself to the furthest setting. I would set the stick at zero, and move it to the left gradually, and I could see on the control settings it was gradually moving. When I moved the stick to the right however, it would go from zero to the furthest setting right.

So, I contacted Thrustmaster on June 5, 2014 and advised them of the issue. What they have put me through is beyond question, the most ridiculous set of hoops that I have ever encountered. They have put me through everything from downloading and rechecking the calibration, to video taping the issue and sending that to them. Even when they could clearly see the issue on video, I had to cut the USB cable off the bad unit and send them a picture of this before they would agree to send out a replacement. Absolutely unheard of.

The replacement was to be by June 30,2014. Twenty-six emails later and as of this date, July 10, 2014, I still have no replacement.

The stick works, to a point. However, their version of customer service is without question, the worst I have EVER dealt with bar none. I was in business for thirty-two years and I can tell you, if any of my staff treated people like this, I would fire them without question. These people seem paranoid or are under some delusion that their product(s) do not fail. Ridiculous.

When you have a product, you build in a certain percentage of defects. That is just doing business correctly. This is so far out in left field that I shudder to think what other users have been through with this company. Seriously Thrustmaster, if you need someone to fix your customer service issue, give me a ring.

I have ALL the emails to back this up as well as the photographs and several videos that I submitted to Thrustmaster to back this up.

movements of the fighters are much slower then wii boxing or victorious boxers which makes it more realistic & strategy more important. it is very easy to track & see when a fighter is about to & is punching you or blocking.

--- no music: only a few grunt noises
--- only 4 boxer choices to start with:
one being very overweight & hairy, though give points for graphics, I didn't want to choose him nor fight him because it was too realistic. lol
--- unresponsive to normal punches & blocks:
I did the tutorial, it worked there, but in the ring? nope. I couldn't do a body block for the life of me & head block took several attempts each time. instead of fighting, I just started experimenting & counting how many times the game responded to my punching: 2 out of 4 times. sometimes only 1 out of 4 times even for very slow, good form punches.
--- lack of punching choices: there were no hooks & I forget if there were uppercuts, I think so, but I think I got it to respond 1x to do that though I made repeated attempts in my game response experiment. there is only mostly jabs & punches & holding down B or Z for super punches/jabs.

Why a 1 star? It's obvious. The core game was just released not that long ago and Bungie/Activision thought it be a good idea to have the gull and announce ""expansions?"" That just tells me that Bungie didn't even #@$&ing finish Destiny then. It also tells me that they really don't know the true value of an expansion. Because this is obviously just DLC. It's just Mini chucks of the game Bungie could have easily added to the game at launch OR provide for free to people who already dished out $60-$100+ AND have to have pay a monthly online account. You know, PATCHES. ""NO,"" says the Activision representative to Bungie. ""Let's continue to screw up gaming and boast how we already have our future 'expansions planned."" This is just laughable as it is asinine. A true game developer would not have their first ""expansions"" planned as soon as the core game is released! Their goal should be to perfect it by providing to their customers a reason to continue playing with their high level characters. That is what a good MMO or ""social"" online game even though it's multiplayer based would and should strive towards first.

The main story can be beat in 8-15 hours with loads of repetition, the multiplayer is fun, but already lacking in content. So they are openly selling this NOW!? World of Warcraft was released in 2004 and had 11 MAJOR PATCHES before it's first official expansion which was released in 2007!!! And in 2004, it had a real open world to explore and hours, no Weeks of content compared to this made for console mindset trash.
""But destiny isn't a full fledged MMO"" somebody will inform you. So I ask, ""THEN WHAT THE HELL IS IT THEN!?"" Why even bother!?

Basically, if you haven't bought the game, let me resume it in few sentences. They spent far more time in trying to develop this cash milking idea of real money auction house than they ever spent on working in the story line, mechanics, game depth, etc etc. I mean, as their crash-n-burn launch was happening, literally, their message from the Blizzard team on their website was regarding how the real-money auction house was delayed for few weeks.....really? That shows you were their mind is, while millions of players in north america were angry because they couldn't play their single player game that requires full time internet connection, according to Blizzard the most pressing issue at that moment that required inmediate addressing was....the fact that their Real money Auction house was down.

If you are a RPG lover, or just a player that enjoys the occassional good RPG and has played any of the recent ones...save your money. You will get bored of diablo 3 in propably a week or 2. The only reason to continue playing this game beyong the first 2 full runs (which happens really fast), is to farm for money or try getting the most amaizing gear ever which btw ends up being completely pointless because there is not even a PvP system (they say it will be released in the future, but they said the same almost 2 years ago about SC2 team support, market and other features, and still hasn't happened).

I mean honestly, coming to play diablo 3 from recently released RPGs like Mass Effect 3, Kingsdoms of Amalaur, Skyrim and others, you feel that this game should be free, or it was made by an Indi company. Err...nevermind, Indi companies have better inspiration and would've probably written a better more compelling story line.

Bottom line, a poor RPG for today's market, specially coming from recently released RPGs that are now half the price almost. Mediocre mechanics, 0 game depth and a story line that a 5th grader could've written better in less than a week. It's basically Diablo 2 with updated graphics and more streamlined and dumbed down interface mechanics and no comparabble story telling. Worst part is...... that you can't expect anything better than this from Blizzard in the future. Oh, yeah, did I metioned that the game failed to work for the first 5 days after lanunch? and that their forums continue to be plagued by people having horrible experiences with errors, crashes, unsupported video cards, and no less importantly a recently wave of hackings that happen on real time to people that have authenticators, double firewalls, etc... and Blizzards resonse seems to be ""your problem bro""?? Yeah....",Blizzard lost the charm. Diablo 3 mediocre at best.,1338163200,51,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

Through each title release they have been removing traditional PC features such as server browsers, large maps and LAN play. The biggest insult was COD 1 and 2 were originally fantastic WWII single player games with multiplayer a nice extra feature you could play if you wanted to.

I know there is some rudimentary skill involved but for the most part its run around with your head cut off spraying and praying hoping you can level up to the weapons that shoot 1000 rounds per second. I sarcastically joke there. Sniper guns are pretty useless due to the map sizes/confinement. The majority of the maps I've played so far in Blops 2(lvl 21) are way to small. The weapons have become corny to me with how fast some can shoot.

As a FPS PC gamer since Wolfenstein the genre on the PC has fallen to it's lowest with the latest COD releases. All so Activision can make a quick buck. Devs, please don't put console style play on an advanced gaming platform. It makes you look lazy and uncreative. You've done nothing but take away PC features and charge us more for a rinse and repeat game series.

Give me back my local LAN play and online servers browsers as we had back in the day. Give me back the great single player it used to have.

I will not buy another COD game at this point if they continue on this path. My LAN group no longer buys COD titles as of COD Modern Warfare 2. I know Blops 2 made a ton of money.

Pros:
The device is small, and coordinates with the white XBox 360 accessories.
One of the few devices on the market which seems to have Windows Vista 64bit drivers. Not released on the driver CD that came with the device of course - you had to download them from the xbox site.

Cons:
Would not connect to 2 different XBox 360 controllers.
Eventually forces other USB peripherals offline.

I used two different wireless XBox 360 controllers and neither one was connecting.  After making several attempts to make a connection with one or the other, I called XBox 360 accessory support.  The first person i spoke to had no idea what I was talking about.  I explained it at some length, and then was put on hold.

Some 15 minutes later, he returned after consulting with another person and proceeded to give me wrong information about where to go to determine if it was connected. When I corrected him, I was put on hold again. He returned and told me that (contrary to the documentation) the controller device would not show that it was connected in the same way it did on the console. When pointed out that the documentation disagreed with him, he told me that the item was defective and I should just return it to the store and get a different one.

When I noted that he didn't seem to know enough about it to determine if it were working or not, he passed me on to a supervisor.  She seemed to know a little more, but not much.  She finally gave up and indicated that she would need to look it up and call me back. As you can imagine, Microsoft never called back.

I left the receiver plugged in and the next morning my usb Bluetooth keyboard and mouse were not working. I unplugged them, and after rebooting, I was able to reconnect them. The following evening, they were disconnected again. I removed the XBOX wireless receiver, and then had to reboot again before the Bluetooth devices would reconnect.

Not only does this thing NOT work, it causes other perfectly good devices to stop working as well. I am unwilling to go out and buy an external powered USB hub when I built my PC with several on-board USB ports so I wouldn't have to go buy an external hub.  This thing is crazy.

By reading through the reviews here you can tell what one of the major problems are: it takes too long and too much effort to assemble the gun, and the games that utilize it aren't worth that effort.  Once assembled, it feels rather robust, although that little nunchuck cord holder will break for sure.  Once you have the gun, forget any notion that you'll be able to effectively use any of the buttons on the remote other than B.  Then comes the play control.  Having the remote mounted on top of the light gun gives you MUCH less accuracy than you'd have if you were using just the remote by itself.  Aiming and shooting is extremly clumsy, and the sensor bar's weakness is even more evident here.

Then comes Link's Crossbow Training.  This game is a waste of time.  It's overly difficult given the clumsiness of the gun, and it seems as though it was thrown together in a single day.  It doesn't even come in a DVD case...just a cheap paper sleeve like Wii Sports.  I played the game without the gun, and actually did much better while still being pleasantly challenged.

They've always seemed boring and uneventful, not to mention incredibly silent and dead. Oblivion, the fourth entry in the series, has been heralded as one of the greatest games ever made--if not THE greatest--by many people, some of which I know, yet it's baffling how I can't even fathom a good reason to enjoy playing it. And trust me when I say this, when Skyrim was announced, EVERYBODY was stoked to get their hands on it. And when it was released, many spent their entire nights--and even some of their work days--playing the game. I just recently had the ""honor"" of playing the game on all three optional platforms (PC, XBOX 360, and PS3), all with their current updates and patches, and now, I have come to give my two cents...or two-hundred dollars.

---STORY---
The narrative begins with you, a presently faceless and nameless prisoner being shipped off to Helgen to be executed in front of a small town in what appears to be the middle of nowhere. You're introduced to a small group of characters, two of which you'll never see again after this opening scene, and just before you're about to be executed, a dragon suddenly appears and wrecks the entire village. You make a ""daring"" escape through the rubble and ashes of Helgen, eventually being free to explore the world of Skyrim. You later discover that you are a mythical being known as the Dovahkiin, or ""Dragonborn"", and it is your destiny to slay the mighty Alduin, the same dragon that invaded Helgen, in order to save the world. Along the way, you'll meet a handful of characters that will assist you on your journey, and you'll be offered many alternate paths on your way to the final battle with Alduin.

So, let me ask you: did you enjoy that tidbit of narrative? Really? I'm glad, because it's LITERALLY the only thing you've got to enjoy in terms of a story. There's nothing else in this game's plot that makes it stand out above anything else: you're a chosen hero, you find the evil dragon that's threatening the world, and you kill it. End of story. There's absolutely nothing here that will keep you on edge or in suspense, because every single thing about the story is predictable and boring. None of the main characters are memorable, and you'll forget their names and faces almost as soon as you meet them. The story won't take you but a few hours to finish, but really, what's next? There aren't anymore plot elements you can seek out to gain you closure, and when you defeat Alduin, the story just sort of...ends. There's no epic ending cutscene, there's no tugging at your heart strings with an appreciative ending, hell, there aren't even any credits you can watch that are supported by the opening theme! Things just go on like nothing happened.

---GAMEPLAY---
Whew...Okay, let's get started. There's a lot to cover, so just bear with me. Let's start with controls. They're simple enough, and I'll admit they did a good job in mapping actual controller buttons to the keys from the keyboard when it came to pressing the correct buttons to perform the proper actions. I have no real problem with the controls, except for wishing they mapped different buttons to different actions when they ported this game to the consoles.

Now, let's talk about Quests. You know, the bread of an open-world RPG. You meet random NPC's in towns and cities, talk to them, and eventually, you'll get a quest to complete. Most of these quests will be labeled as ""Objectives,"" which means they start off as meager jobs, but very quickly erupt into something much bigger and, of course, much more tedious to get done. When you complete a quest, you get a reward and a small, hardly noticeable completion dialog box in the center of your screen. Your reward is displayed--BARELY--in the top-left corner of the screen for about five seconds. Most of the time, you're not even aware you got your reward. Would've been nice to make it a LITTLE more obvious that I actually finished the task I was asked to do.

Third, the inventory. When you access the inventory screen, you're greeted with the options to check your status, look at the different kinds of magic and skills you have, open the map, and view your current collection of items. If you have the game set to autosave, this is where it happens at the regular intervals you set it to. On the status screen, you can view the perks and status of your character, looking through everything you currently have unlocked. The map...well, do I really have to explain what it does? It lets you fast-travel through the world of Skyrim, provided you've already been to the location you want to go to. The items screen is displayed in categories, ranging from typical potions to your wide array of weapons and armor. You can also access the settings screen, where you can view your current quests and objectives, change in-game settings, and save and load data.

Now, we move on to the WORST part: the combat. By equipping a weapon (or being stupid enough to go in unarmed), you can attack enemies you find using those weapons (or your fists). You can either choose to play the game in first-person view or third-person view, and if you're smart, you'll play the game about 95% of the time in third-person.

Fighting enemies is dreadful. Hell, even swinging your weapon at the air is dreadful. Everything about combat is terrible. For starters, it's boring; you're literally just swinging your weapon in the same boring, repetitive animation sequence, chipping away at their health bar until they drop dead. Many could argue that's the point of any game with combat, but I would wholeheartedly disagree. After all, COMBAT IS THE PART OF THE GAME WHERE MOST OF THE ACTION IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE. If the combat is boring, guess what? Roughly 90% of your game is boring. You're going to be fighting everywhere you go; dungeons, cities, towns, even on the fields just outside of stables--wherever you go, you're bound to run into some enemies just waiting to gut you. So why, exactly, does it have to be so BORING?

Also, and this is unfortunately true for a lot of RPG's released these days, but magic is virtually useless. Seriously. You travel all throughout the world of Skyrim, learn all of these seemingly nifty magic spells and Dragon Shouts, and you'll use them...I dunno, a few times? Maybe? I only had to use Dragon Shouts when the story progression forced me to. I NEVER had to rely on any magic, or even any of the transformations the game had to offer. I never found any joy in riding dragons, I didn't find any solace or happiness in killing random monsters and looting their corpses for items and money, and I CERTAINLY found no remorse in waiting for the game to get harder. Even on Master difficulty, this game is a breeze.

Lastly, let's discuss leveling up. When you use certain skills or magic, your proficiency in that specific spell or skill will increase, which then increases your progress in your current Level. If you ask me, this is literally the most asinine way to give your players a level-up system that provides them with choice. There are WAY too many different skill trees to improve, and yes, you guessed right: you don't get NEARLY enough points to spend on all of them. The game forces you to have a certain proficiency level in that skill tree before you can unlock the next perk, but what happens if you're not that far and you just leveled up? You really want that perk, right? How are you going to get that perk that requires 60 proficiency in that skill tree, and you only have it at 29? Too bad. Either don't increase your level until you spend HOURS trying to raise your proficiency to that level, or just skip the perk and find another one you might enjoy having. What, pray tell, was stopping ANYONE from just putting in a basic choice-based level system in this game? Like, when you level up, you're given a list of things you can improve RIGHT NOW and you can choose whichever one you desire AT THAT MOMENT--you know, like in Kingdoms of Amalur? Y'know, surprisingly, I find myself comparing the two a lot. Maybe because...*Gasp* AMALUR IS A BETTER GAME!!

---PRESENTATION---
This is, without a single doubt in my mind, the BIGGEST problem of the game. Skyrim takes place in this huge, MASSIVE world, and yes, there's a ton to see and do all throughout the game. There are so many people to meet and greet, plenty of quests and objectives to complete, tons of exclusive weapons and armor to obtain and forge for, huge amounts of dungeons and locations to discover and explore, and even a bunch of different side-stories to contribute to. Yeah, sounds all fine and dandy at first, right? Now, let's get to the part that's going to make the entire world despise me.

This game is empty. Yes. Empty. But not in a content-based sense. There's plenty to do, but none of it--NONE of it--is fun. The world is big and broad, sure, but it's so lifeless and boring that you don't WANT it to be big; you just want to get to the next town or dungeon and be done with it, already. Character models are sloppy and hideous, none of the side-stories contribute anything to the main plot experience, and even fighting dragons--the ONE thing this game is universally praised for--becomes insufferable after you've brought a few down. And worst of all, the entire game--in all three versions--is LITTERED WITH GAME-BREAKING GLITCHES. Crashes, bugs, graphical and system errors at random intervals...I can't even BEGIN to count them all! There are not enough numbers to count the amount of times the game crashed on me, not to mention the number of times I found myself trapped in place because the camera didn't buffer me out of a damn corner that I could have easily slipped through. I have literally CLIPPED THROUGH MOUNTAINS while exploring and trying to find new locations, I have sent enemies and NPC's flying into the sky by simply bumping into them while running, and I have even broken the game in its entirety by utilizing a few in-game glitches to instantly level every perk and skill tree to maximum, as well as break the enchantment system by making weapons deal more than 10,000,000 damage a hit and armor giving me +10,000,000 health, stamina, and magic, not to mention ridiculously-overpowered abilities. How is it that Bethesda doesn't see fit to FINISH their games?

---SOUNDTRACK---
While I enjoyed the musical scores that played through my time in Skyrim, there are too few to even call this a soundtrack. There are only a few songs that are very commonly recycled as you play the game, and most of the time, the tracks don't even change to properly fit the situation. I can't even count the amount of times I've been fighting a dragon while the peaceful town or city theme was playing in the background. It completely kills any sense of suspense or tension in the atmosphere...what little there is to be found.

---OVERALL RATING: 2/10---
Skyrim is a massive disappointment to fans of the Elder Scrolls series (if there are really any die-hards out there), and an even bigger disappointment to anybody who countenanced the thought that they actually paid money for this game. This is not an RPG. It's an adventure game that TRIES to do everything right, but fails in all departments. Don't get me wrong; I meagerly appreciate the effort, but if the final product (I won't say ""finished,"" because this game clearly isn't) doesn't succeed in making the mark it was meant to, then you've accomplished precisely nothing. Skyrim does just that; it accomplishes nothing it was supposed to. It fails in nearly every aspect, with the quality of the soundtrack and the almost nonexistent feeling of freedom being its only saving graces. Like Final Fantasy VII, I know full well that a lot--A LOT--of people love this game to death, but much like with my FF7 review, I think it's doing the world justice to give them a wake-up call with exactly how terrible this waste of data really is.","A painstaking ""adventure"" through an empty world.",1427932800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I've listed the top offending errors below:

(1) Environmental errors: There was a section in the first level where I moved behind a fence. I came to the end of the fence but couldn't move past it, even though nothing was blocking my path. I had to loop all the way back and go around. This is a pretty basic error, and yet quality testing missed it - not a good sign.

(2) Enemy detection errors: I was fighting a slew of enemies on the second level and before I could advance further, I had to eliminate all the ground troops. There was one left on my radar and I flew down to find he was....under the concrete. Yes, this enemy somehow fell UNDER THE CONCRETE. I had to reset and start the level all over again.

(3) Poor targeting system: The only way I could shoot a target is if the crosshairs were centered on an enemy at that specific moment. That means if Iron Man was running, flying, or dodging, it's pretty likely that my laser blasts or missiles would miss the target.

(4) Hyper-sensitive flight system: The flight controls operate on a hair trigger. If I pressed the hover button too hard, Iron Man shot straight up. If I pressed the hover button too lightly, he dropped like a stone. When I hit the flight button, Iron Man shot forward at Ludicrous Speed - and I couldn't slow down. At all.

In a nutshell, I spent most of my game time flying around at breakneck speed with little control, trying not to slam into buildings, attempting to hit multiple enemies with a poor weapons system, while trying to break a time limit.

Despite the poor reviews this game got from pretty much everywhere, the concept seemed sound. The mostly positive reviews here on Amazon gave me some hope as well. It is supposed to be an action packed cover third person shooter a la Gears of War. It is supposed to poke fun at video games--kind of a Scary Movie for the video game afincianados. What we got instead is one of the most repetitive frustrating experiences I have ever had with a video game on my PS3. First off, I did not finish this game. Not for lack of trying. There is a part that is in the dark where there is a sniper and endlessly respawning enemies(who will sometimes spawn BEHIND you) I believe it is the end of chapter 3 of this crap. I died there about 20 times. So I figured maybe the difficulty level(set on the medium Major Hazard difficult level) was too high. There is no way to change the difficulty mid level so I replayed the entire level on easy. Again I am in the dark with the damn sniper and respawning enemies. Again I get killing 10 times!!! At this point, I pulled the disk out of the drive and broke it into 10 pieces!! What about this level did the game designer find to be fun? What is fun about respawning enemies in the dark? What is the fun of one hit sniper kills(from a sniper that you CANNOT kill in this part) I think the developers forgot the whole point of a game is to HAVE FUN. You can refer to my Damnation review to see other games I have played. I have played lots of games on my PS3. Only a couple were as frustrating at this one.

At least Ninja Gaiden never pretended ot be a game for everyone--it is a difficult game which only a few really hardcore gamers have ever finished. There is another part of the game where you are a on a sniper rifle.. Fun right? What is more fun that popping a bad guy's head with a sniper rifle. BTW, there is no violence at ALL in this shooter. No blood--no gore and the bodies of your enemies disappear even before they hit the floor! Okay but sniping is still fun right even without gore(as evidenced with Turok) Wrong. This is arcade style sniping. Kill 20 guys in about a minute!! Uh developers? That is not fun. Just frustrating!! Ugghhh. I hate this game.

Package arrived release day at around 5pm est. After opening the packaging, i setup the system and  the system would not boot up. Instead I received a blue pulsing light on the top and nothing else. I then searched the internet to see what was going on. I checked for HDMI issue, but my system was fine in that regards. I also check to make sure HDD was secure and that was fine also. The system just will not boot. I am downloading patch now and will try that. if that fails, I will test the HDD to make sure its functioning.

I have to say that this one may border on one of the worst I've ever played. Now I have to commend the presentation, the aesthetics, the art, the music, the visuals on the whole. It's also a very smooth, kinetic title. It's pretty spiffy to play through.

The problem is just how vapid it is. We're talking just... ridiculous levels of non-game. This is from the team that put out FFX-2, while, outside of being VERY goofy and girlpower happy had some fantastic gameplay systems associated with it. FFXIII does not. The entire progression for all of the title sans Chapter 11 is walking down a hallway from A to B. This may not sound like the pits, but once you tie that in with no deviations, it really grates.

There are no towns, no real subquests or elements, several key character points are actually ABANDONED because there is no way to present or address them due to the limitations of the design. Now that's bad, but you can still make up for that as an on-rails experience, well, it doesn't. The combat engine can, from start to finish, barring the last couple dozen ""hunts"" be breezed through by mashing X and rarely doing a class swap in order to defend or heal up.

Everything is automated, all ability selection, (bad) AI  team mates, if they took away that random class juggle the game wouldn't be a game.

Usually RPGs make up for lack of action or input with micromanagement or planning or strategy there is none of that. The character development here is done through a Crystalarium (sp) board which is completely linear and weapon upgrading which is also completely linear. There is no thought, no deviation, you grind and you grind more and you mash X.

Bad enough yet? Well you get no choice over your party, character classes or anything else for the first 25 hours of the game.

Just unreal.

That's the gameplay, now the story is a whole 'nother trainwreck. Basically just prepare to hear:

1.) Fal'cie
2.) L'cie
3.) Focus

Repeated ad nauseum for the 35-40 hours the main quest takes because between hours 2 and 39 there is no narrative progression. It's a lot of jargon, a lot of dwelling on the same points, a lot of awkward grunts and sighs and a dash of D-tier anime ""charm"".

One single character has dialogue that isn't so completely banal that it'd make a high school AV club moan. And that's Sazh, Sazh is a character still rooted in the 50's as far as black characters go, but he is still a big improvement on say, the likes of Barret from Final Fantasy VII. Kudos Japan!

The game actually tries to present itself like a big character drama, and also a big story sweeping two vast worlds but fails rather spectacularly in both, with a vastly underdeveloped cast and world designs that have no lore, history or general consequence to them and act more as a general potluck of random themes and designs, sort of akin to a themed Mario world.

The worst part of all of this, is that any little bit of story or context or sense you wish to gleen from the game has to be read, through a haphazardly written datalog in the menus. If you expect the game to actually tell its story through actual sequencing and design, then guess again.

It's not the WORST game ever made, it's easy to cut through, as it puts absolutely no strain or resistance on the player and it looks gorgeous while being cut through. I can think of bigger crimes than merely being a design train wreck, there are titles that are technical AND design train wrecks!

Still, worst in series, avoid. My suggestion would be to scope out Resonance of Fate, which is a challenging, mechanically innovative title with some good charm. Probably the best JRPG this generation after Demons Souls.",All aboard the non-game train!,1270166400,10,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Steam is a red herring, here. This is a Windows LIVE game which allows you to install it via Steam, but when you run it, you have to set up your Windows LIVE account in order to use it. Be WARNED, this will take upwards of 20 minutes of horrible messing around if you're not already a Windows LIVE user, and Microsoft will as for everything including your zip code and phone number in order to play this game!

Specifically, I dealt with:

* Windows LIVE overlay pops up as soon as you try to play
* Requires that you type your username and password (if you use a password safe tool, it won't let you paste the password at all! My Windows LIVE password is a long, random string of letters, numbers and punctuation which I did not enjoy being forced to manually type 3 times during the install)
* If your account is old (mine was) or you never created one, it will fail and send you to a browser to create one.
* In the browser it will ask all sorts of personal info, and fail if you don't provide it!
* Once you create an account, it will tell you that it needs to update the Windows LIVE client and dump you back into the game, but there is no ""exit the game"" option until you're done with Windows LIVE setup! You have to force-exit the game from windows and re-start it to get Windows LIVE to behave
* On re-starting, it will tell you (after you manually type your password again, because the update threw it away) that your Windows LIVE account doesn't have a gamer tag (I didn't want one, but too bad), so you get thrown out to a browser again, only this time if you use a non-IE browser, it will subvert that and run IE, even though it didn't last time to create the account!
* Once you associate a gamer tag, you can manually tab back to the game and then you can log in (might have to restart game again).
* At this point you get a mildly passable port of MK.

Down sides (as if that were not bad enough):

* Though you installed it through steam, there is no Steam support, so no achievements, no saves to the Steam Cloud, no anything.
* The graphics are the original with no touch-ups at all... on the one hand, this is good for authenticity, but on the other hand you will want to claw your eyes out.
* It demands that you enter the ""CD Key"" (I installed this via steam, and the game can definitely confirm with Steam that I had rights to it, but NOOOOO), but the UI for entering the key is really, really bad. It moves the cursor around if you touch the mouse, it randomly highlights and fills in letters in boxes, and pasting a key only works if you happen to get it to select the first box and stay there long enough to paste.

The multiplayer should also be fun, but it becomes impossible to even log in to the game because there are severe server problems. The servers have been down now for over 24hours. When they are up, plan on much frustration as hosts that quit kill your ability to log into another game.  The MP can also be buggy and can only be cleared by restarting the entire system. There are no hosts provided by Activision, Infinity Ward or the server provider who Infinity Ward likes to blame for its own online failures.

If you are like me and purchased this game for the online content (I prefer ROFM to this for a FPS single player game), then you will be severly disappointed.  A game like Warhawk is more cartoonish, but at least you can log in and see active games hosted by the company that made the game.  They also tell you when their servers are down and when they expect them online again.

It just doesn't exist. They'd rather make a game that cheats and looks stupid and unrealistic. I cannot begin to tell you how bad this game cheats...and how user-skill is completely thrown out the window....but I'll try.

The ""Legend"" skill level might be the most controlled piece of garbage I have ever played. You cannot control the accuracy of your pitches (they just move your pitch right into their hot zone)...you are not rewarded for guessing the right pitches and having perfect timing...and you constantly get screwed on phantom tags by the A.I. And one of my favorites is when you finally do make a perfect pitch, the A.I. crushes it anyway. It could be outside the strike zone all together but it will still fly out of the ballpark. Unreal.

People think this game is hard. It's not hard. It just cheats like crazy. The concept isn't hard....it's getting the game to reward you for having some skill that makes it difficult. It just doesn't. Why even give a person the controller? You cannot do a thing unless the A.I. lets you. Seems like everytime runners are on, the A.I. gets you to ground into a DP. I get a pitch up in the zone, press up on the right stick to force a fly ball....and yep, you guessed it, it STILL is a ground ball double play. NO USER SKILL. And the timing thing is a joke. I've had perfect timing and it still a weakly hit ball. NO USER SKILL.

I guess that's the way it is now. No matter how well you think you're playing, you'll still lose. I've been up 4 or 5 runs and the very next inning, I cannot locate a pitch, I cannot get the A.I. out and every hit of theirs is either in the gap or over the wall. Complete A.I. control. EA, 2K and now Sony....all run the same program. Cheat and control. Forget making it REALISTICALLY more difficult. Let's just glitch and control the game. It's the lazy way to make a sports game.

I think they are trying to fix things, but they have done so many things wrong so far that I just can't give this game a good rating. I have been plagued with problem after problem.

I have two copies of this game. My girlfriend and my best friend both bought me a copy without speaking with one another. It was very sweet. Well, I also have two computers that can play this game. One is a custom built computer and the other is a Mac. Well I convinced my girlfriend to play with me. The only problem is... well, we couldn't play the game together. Why, you might ask? Well, I could install it on my Mac just fine. There was no problem other than the considerable lag. I had to drop the video settings of course, but there was just constant lag.

No, I couldn't play with her because there was an installation problem on my PC. It took 3 days of troubleshooting to finally figure it out. You know, uninstall, reinstall, re-download the client. Run as admin. Run in XP mode. Nothing worked. No I had to manually kill the agent.exe process and manually start the process from within a folder before I could actually run Diablo 3 and install it. That made it work. None of the other stuff like updating my system, disabling my anti-virus, running in compatibility mode or anything made this game work. So, Blizzard, you failed big on this one. 3 days without being able to play.

What was my next problem? Oh, the constant lag is a constant problem. Updating things like my network adapter and reworking my wiring didn't fix anything. Checking my channels to find the best reception didn't help. It still lags.

The first few days the servers were constantly down. The auction house IS constantly down. The servers are still constantly down for some kind of maintenance. They threw this piece of crap out onto the market before ever really doing much. This doesn't feel like 12 years of planning and thinking for a new game. This feels like some piece of crap game they put together in about a year.

Then about a week in my buddy gets hacked and loses all of his stuff. Seems odd, but didn't surprise me too much as he isn't too big on passwords. I knew that. Oh, but a few days later my account gets hacked. Then I am in the forums noticing that there are a lot of people being hacked. Then another friend was hacked. Does this really sound that common to you? You think people who have been gaming for years get hacked this easily? No this was a Blizzard problem. Did they help me out? Sure.. in a way. Let me tell you how they helped me out. First, it took 24 hours to even respond. Then it took another 24 hours for them to let me know that I had to make sure I understood what a ""rollback"" was. How insulting to my intelligence. Then they finally rolled me back after another 24 hours. They didn't offer to give me any gold or help me out in any way. I was out millions of gold in items, 150,000 gold in definite gold lost from the roll back, a day lost on a character that I was working on, and the lame moderator just makes some snarky comments and says it's all taken care of now. Meanwhile the items I did have depreciated badly because the economy changed so quickly. I basically lost 3-4 days worth of game time and all kinds of other things because Blizzard is compromised. I made some suggestions for their security, but I am sure it fell on deaf ears. They just want everyone to use their authenticators because they assure everyone is 100% impossible to hack. Bullcrap. I'm not even saying it was impossible to hack me before, but it shouldn't have been easy.

The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I see some changes coming that might make the game worth swallowing in some ways. There are still tons of problems. They are firm on not letting people go ""free world"" in the game like Diablo 2. You have to select a quest and go from there. It's tedious. The farming is tedious. The game is tedious. There is no more rushing really. The leveling is boring.

I'll be honest. I would have been happy with Diablo 2 with a few changes in there. I wanted similar characters and play styles. They took powerful characters and a fun game and made it tedious.

They were even so arrogant as to point out that ""there is no cow level"" on loading screens. Oh, you mean one of the funnest things in Diablo 2 isn't in your game anymore and you think that is a good thing? Oh, let me shake your hand. Then there is this new unicorn level that they make ridiculously tedious (noticing a pattern here) to get into. I haven't even gone into it yet, because I don't feel like trying to farm the 5-6 different pieces required and the 100,000 gold item to make the level and not gain anything from it other than maybe a few giggles while slaughtering a unicorn.

I also have a Corsair Vengeance (with red LED lighting).  Overall, I prefer the Corsair Vengeance because has  two dedicated buttons at the top to control the LED lighting, and a dedicated volume control at the top, and because the Corsair Vengeance has a metal case (more solid / substantial). This keyboard is heavier than your average keyboard, but not as heavy as one with a metal case. Apart from price, I would pick the Corsair Vengeance over the Rosewill Apollo; but both are great keyboards.  I can not imagine someone being displeased with either one.

After WCW started to lose popularity, THQ started to do WWF-themed wrestling games. When it did, even beginning on the N64, there were hints that they were turning what was a good system into complete crap. They finally succeded (so to speak, if that was their actual intent) when they started the SmackDown! series. I have no problems with the graphics, the entrances, or the sound in this game. I have the biggest problem however with the gameplay and how the game controls.
First off, they gave the game arcade style feel and controls. Big mistake. They also made it more like the actual show: you have to continually punch the guy before you can start doing grappling moves. I may be in the minority, but constantly punching a guy gets old fast. I want to be able to start throwing suplexes and hitting piledrivers right off the bat. Secondly, the game's A.I. has gotten extremely intelligent. Too intelligent. The game can kick your ass unless you're a great gamer, and I'm just average, maybe a little below. Mainly because of the counter system. The game goes like this: punch, punch, punch, punch, grapple, move-counter move-counter move, etc. You'll get countered excessively, and your counters won't work most of the time. Yes, it is a lot like the actual wrestling you watch on TV, but for a wrestling game to be fun in my opinion, it can't be realistic in terms of following how an actual wrestling match would go. I don't want to spend over an hour or more in a match, 15-30 minutes is plenty, unless it's a Royal Rumble-type match.
THQ threw out the window the great grappling engine they had with the N64 games and has replaced it with this tripe. I honestly don't understand what the fans see in this series of game. I guess if you like your matches in the game to follow how the matches on the show work, and you enjoy the actual wrestling to a be a chore and full of non-stop punching and countering, than this is the game for you. If you want an actual FUN wrestling game, then I suggest you stick with THQ's WCW games on the N64.

You earn keys and scrap. You earn them VERY slowly. Keys give you a (very, VERY small) chance at a good gun. Scrap lets you buy a new gun. I am about to get to level 55 for the first time. I have made, at a guess enough scrap to buy 1 legendary weapon, if I had saved ALL of my scrap for that one gun. Epic is the best tier of weapon and costs 2 1/2 times a legendary. So... about a month to earn enough scrap to buy ONE legendary by playing the game, if you never buy anything else and play a LOT.

You get about 8 keys an hour playing. 30 keys to unlock a chest with a chance at a legendary or epic weapon. I have one of each. Unfortunately the legendary is only OK, the epic is a worthless shotgun (and I like shotguns) that uses your own health as ammo.

And it is unfair. Most of the epic guns are over-powered (e.g. NV4 - Flatline. Infinite damage range and reduces sway) and unless you are extremely lucky you will NEVER have that weapon. Certainly you will never have more than a few Epic guns.

Or you can pay real money to buy keys.

No internet connection, no online authentication, no proprietary game launchers. Just the game you bought and you. Bought this game for my wife and it is a damn nightmare to get it up and running. So many problems, I couldn't believe it. Let me break it down.

1. You need to set up an Origin account. This one isn't the worst, but I find it annoying that I need to create an EA login and password just to play a game I bought. I don't plan on using Origin for anything else, so this is definitely an inconvenience.

2. Origin constantly crashes. I tried installing this on my wife's computer, which is windows 10. Origin would crash a few seconds after launching so I tried a few things - restarted the PC, checked for any updates, checked drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled Origin. Nothing worked. Tried googling the problem and it seems to be a common occurrence - Origin does not play nice with windows 10. So I tried launching Origin through compatibility modes for Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8. None of them were stable. They all crashed. Great. I then tried installing it on MY laptop, which is still windows 7 by default and after a few brief crashes, it finally loaded the store and let me type in the product code. THANK GOODNESS.

3. There is no way to install from the DVD that came with the game. When you insert the disc, an autolaunch window pops up telling you to install Origin, set up EA account, and then install Sims 4. Ok. I did the first two things....let me install Sims 4. But it won't. There are no options. If you click continue, it will just try to install Origin again. So you close it, pop the disc out, pop it in....and it loops the same prompts. Install Origin, Set up account...I GET IT. I already did those things. SO...I look through my Origin launcher for options. Nothing about installing from disc, only lets you download. Great. Now I gotta wait HOURS for this thing to download 10 gigs of data so I can play the game I ALREADY BOUGHT AND HAVE A DVD INSTALL DISC FOR. What a waste of time.

Don't bother with this crap. Just play the old games. EA is too worried about making sure the costumer jumps through hoops to authenticate their purchase that it just is not worth it in the end.

If you played good games like the old ones I mentioned or Burnout 3, MK Deception, and Return to Castle Wolfenstein even (reinventing an old school classic, feller) maybe you'd see the light.

This feature is virtually standard on every other RTS.  No such luck, that improvement was just too sophisticated.  The real disappointment though was the much hyped online match making.

While i can lay my finger on the left mouse button, my other finger must constantly hover just above the right mouse button.  There have been so many inadvertent right clicks because of this, that i finally switched back to my standard microsoft optical mouse, because it was ruining gaming for me.

On top of that, I've experienced what a lot of others have complained about on here, the mouse's optical tracker going haywire.  Generally what happens to me is the mouse won't sense ""down"" anymore, but it sense left, right and up just fine.  I jiggle the mouse around and lift if off the pad a couple of times and it seems to fix itself, but this is unacceptable when you're playing a video game, especially if you're online and others are depending on you.  I've seen reviewers claiming that this is because of dust on the pad, but I don't believe that.  The microsoft mouse i mentioned has no such problems, and it is optical as well.  I even took to regularly using a lint roller on the pad, and that made no difference at all.

1.0,False,"08 6, 2003",A150OWFGFIQF4C,B000067FDY,Tessera,"This review will be short and sweet: save your money. Here's why...
As with the (disappointing) post-Verant International expansions to Sony's popular ""EverQuest"" franchise, ""Star Wars: Galaxies"" is very short on content, but very high on greed-driven programming choices. For one thing, forget about making multiple characters on the same account... a courtesy which nearly every previous ""MMORPG game"" ever created has featured. In ""Star Wars: Galaxies,"" you are forcibly limited to *one* and ""only one* character per paid account, period. If you play for 3 months, and discover that you hate that character, you must start all over again from scratch (and will have wasted your previous subscription fees, naturally). Unlike every other game which has preceded it, ""Galaxies"" does not allow you to try out different characters simultaneously until you settle upon the one which you like best. The only possible reason for such an imposed limitation is a simple one: GREED. Sony wants your subscription fees, and this is an obvious ploy to milk as much money from their subscribers as possible. I could accept this a bit better if the game content warranted it, but it does not (the game world is entirely too small and bland overall).
Additionally, when greed such as this so rudely limits the gameplay options, combined with the typically poor to nonexistant customer support (already made famous by Sony's infamous ""EverQuest"" experience)... well, such lack of concern for the gamer *frequently* becomes invasive to the gameplay experience itself.
And that's simply not very much fun, unless you enjoy roleplaying a sucker lining the pockets of grinning Japanese businessmen... um, no thanks.
""Star Wars: Galaxies"" has (thus far) managed to disappoint nearly everyone who has courageously given it a try. Unless you are SERIOUSLY hung up on the ""Star Wars"" films, and simply can *not live* unless you get to be a Han Solo clone in an extremely limited gameplay world, I would recommend passing on this one. Save your money for a more promising game (such as the upcoming ""Worlds of Warcraft"" for example).
Another big thumbs down.
EDITING ADDITION: Back when I wrote this review in August, I was still waiting for Sony to patch and fix the immense number of bugs in SWG. I assumed (based upon Sony's infamous prior history of exploiting their customers and forcing us all to PAY to be Sony's beta testers) that SOE would eventually make the necessary repairs that this game required. After all, the game had only been released fairly recently when I wrote this review. Well, here I am still waiting for those fixes, and it is now October of 2003.
Have they finally properly patched and fixed the unbelievable plethora of bugs in Star Wars Galaxies..? They have not. What's worse... when you complain to them, they become condescending towards you, their paying customer, and attempt to make you feel as if you ""simply do not get it.""
Oh, I get it alright: SWG, just like most other Sony games, is simply a ""get-rich-quick-before-they-catch-on-to-us-and-cancel"" scheme. The various patches applied to this game have made the problems worse, not better. Classes have been nerfed to the point of being nearly un-playable, no one wants to play medics because they are generally unrewarding, hospital-type areas where players MUST go to heal up after battles are overcrowded due to lack of services, and generally, everything in this game seems geared toward making you wait days or weeks before you enjoy even a tiny amount of meaningful ""progress."" Days or weeks that you continue to pay for, whilst getting little to no satisfaction from either the game itself, or Sony's nearly non-existant customer support.
My advice..? I hate to say it, but at this point I favour a MASSIVE and TOTAL BOYCOTT of ALL products from Sony Online Entertainment. Since greed is apparently the sole motivation they have behind their various decisions and practises... then fine: hit them where they apparently live. Hit them in their wallets. I just did... I cancelled every subscription I had to ALL the Sony Online Entertainment games I had been playing, including EverQuest (after nearly 4 years)... another game SOE has managed to nearly destroy after buying the franchise from Verant International.",More Greed From Sony...

They have been dishin out some sh*tty a*s games lately but this has to be the biggest piece of sh*t squaresoft has dispensed out of their behind. So lets take a look at the title first...A little fruity I know. Ok ok lets take it from the basics. I bought the game a year after it came out....Due to the huge hype about. You know all these little nerds sayin ""Man Kingdom Hearts is awesome!!"" or ""Man I couldn't take a crap without Kingdom Hearts"". Personally I dispiesed the game but you know what peer pressure does to you. Living here in Japan squaresoft was hailed as the greatest RPG maker ever which I can understand i.e. Mystic Quest (Personal Fav) Nevertheless with a name like Kingdom Hearts...Makes you question the game. Know in this day in age when to people use the word kingdom? I've never even heard the word empire used unless people were punning at the united states government. Anyways Kingdom makes you think of faries and nonsense...hence disney and their perverted godness. Hearts makes you think of a smelly old love story..Or a great classic card game!! So if the name doesnt drive you away lets see what does.

Upon further dissection the game is simply compiled of a gay character who looks like a cheaply made version of all the Final Fantasy characters. Now for a lot of you readers maybe I should have told you this before but if you don't like Final Fantasy you might...I mean you won't like this game at all. The truth of the matter is, that this game is a fantasy of its own. A bunch of fantasy looking characters hanging out with the queers of Disney. How fun!! So the theme of the game is to search for your gay lover....Actually I never took the time to understand the point of the game though I believe it had to do with searching. Nevertheless the gay characters will pretty much make you want to go and buy Soul Reaver its that bad!! Squaresoft has outdone itself this time. Teaming up with disney must have been a sign of Squaresoft reaching rock bottom. Their time on deathrow was almost up but with Disney on their back nothing is to fear. So they made up some lame queerish characters and made a bad story and whipped it all together...hence ""Kindom Hearts"" How sad. When I remembered great classical games they took time and dedication...This game took a whole bunch of as*holes and just glued them together. The game is retarded as hell and I know for a fact that a 5 year old could throw up a better game then this.

For your own saftey I would stay away from this game. Its cheap graphics, gameplay, music, characters....there are just so many aspects of this game that suck its so hard for me to tell you.

Negatives...

1. The relationships made in this game are difficult and even  harder to maintain. How come you have to interact with everyone and they do not even notice you are alive? They never intiate any conversation with you when you are at a community lot or at your house. The men in the game have a unisex personality and do not differ from the women in the house. What's the difference between making the men, men and the women, women? Their interests are the same, their conversational options are the same, ""Joke"" and ""Chat"". Starting the relationships is VERY slow, you can talk and get close to people and 2 days later they aren't your friend anymore. Snore! There is no general idea of beauty in the game, the looks don't matter, so it doesn't matter what you look like and if this is a simulation game what's real about that? Marxism in its truest form.

2. The language was cute at first but it got annoying when you had to analyze the thought bubbles to figure out how the talk was going. I made a teenager and she was the stereotypical look of beauty and she was treated no different. If you are buying this game because you want to be defiant and deviant, then you have the wrong game. The sex in the game is so far and in between, the most I got out of these lame characters was one lame kiss. You are not treated any different if you have money or not.

3. The game is made for girls, its got the frivilous collecting and decorating.

4. The neighborhood is small and on your block where your house is, if you step out of your house and look down the road its blankness of emptiness. The sims AI is weak most times when they have a problem or need like a bathroom emergency, they are standing right next to the toliet and they don't react until you direct them. They need too much food to live, too much sleep to live and too much social to live. If you are looking for a free environment in this game, how bout all the people that want this idea take it, harness it and put it into the living world!

5. The jobs & the school the sims go to are invisible. So they just disappear. The books they read are only 3 subjects to earn a skill, Mechanical, cooking and cleaning.

6. The DNA code is not really that, its a standard code dictated by the Aspiration of your parents. That is not DNA its just a computer generated code that makes for the same signs are the parents.

7. The balanced aspiration characters are boring as people, the other unstable ones act like addicts. They stay up until the dead of night when they know that they have school or work the next day. So they stay up and obessess over whatever they are lacking in, if it be creative or fun. Then their whole cycle is thrown off because they are offset, not enough sleep, comfort, social or fun.

8. Once you get behind in homework there is no catching up.

Positives...

1. You can fence your sims in the backyard and starve them to Death.

2. You can put a dead Sim family member's grave in the fence with your starving sim.

3. Death comes to all terrible Sims. The animation for Death was the best graphics in the game.

4. The graphical detail was high in the game but what you saw got boring.

5. If you abuse your brats in the game the social workers come and pick them up. That is a great feature.

Quick advice : STAY AWAY!

Really cheap quality, I bought this mouse 3/8/16 and I loved it, everything worked perfectly, the shape is great, ergonomics are great, flashy colors, good grip... And right after the 1st month of NORMAL USE! (average 30hrs in 2 weeks of CSGO, and regular browsing), the left click broke! It started with being harder to click, and a day later it just broke. I have been reading online and this is fairly a common issue for a lot of people, which disappoints me to no end. I refuse to throw $60 down the drain so all I can do is RMA from Razer and wait for the next one to break as well within 1-2 months. I will never again buy ANY Razer product.
Also need to mention that the retailer that sold this mouse to me was PROELECTRONICS DISTRIBUTING. Which I would also recommend STAY AWAY FROM THEM! Awful costumer service.

If everything you've just read didn't deter you from buying this cheap s**t, and you want to give it a try (lol), I HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying it from a reputable computer store (ex: MicroCenter) that will assist you after it breaks no matter what time-frame.

Eventually the ""n"" and ""m"" keys lost sensitivity, and I had to hit the bloody things hard to get the OS (Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit or Ubuntu Linux 8.10 64-bit) to recognize tje keystrokes.  ""n"" was far worse.

So, fair enough.  I exchanged it for a second one.  Unfortunately, after two HOURS of use, I've already had TWO occasions where the ""h"", quote, and right shift key stopped responding -- but started to work again after several minutes of... doing nothing.  How did I test this?  When seeing the ""h"" key wasn't doing squat, I held the key down.  There was a stammering delay between the ""hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""'s.  Sometimes by a factor of seconds.  Adjacent keys ""j"" and ""l"" worked perfectly despite the hang-up with the ""h"".  The most pathetic part is, this new problem didn't happen with the original keyboard.

Having read other reviews, it sounds like the sticking problem AND the non-responsive problems are quite common.  And these people have system specs ranging from older Pentium 4's to the newest i7s.  (Mine is an Intel Q9650 system with 8GB of RAM, running 64-bit Vista and Linux.)

The graphics were terrible, even for playstation, the difficulty was ridiculous and through the roof, your teammates were slow and stupid and the enemies all shot far more accurately then you could.

The difficulty was even backward, from everything I have read on the game- easy was hard and hard was easy. It was like the game wasn't even finished.

Now the game might not be that bad if it just let you relax and stealth through a mission. But, no, every map has an absurdly short timer, forcing you to run headlong from start to finish, shooting wildly at everything around you, trying to get to the end before your team gets slaughtered or the time runs out.

I only ever managed to beat the first mission once- and im pretty good at shooter games- but the second mission was only that much worse.

I have a rule, that I keep every game I own (rather then trading it in) forever and ever because you never know when one day you might want to go back and play it again. This is probably the only game I've ever owned that broke that rule. When I think of what the worst game I ever played was, this is usually what comes to mind.

The sound was terrible, the graphics were terrible, the controls were terrible, the difficulty was terrible, the TIMER was terrible, what little I seen of the AI was not impressive- teammates killing themselves like always- and even the lighting was terrible, forcing you to stare at this strange vista of green and black all the time.

I was a Mario fanatic during my freshman year of highschool. Playing Mario Brothers for hours on end. I would leave the console on at night (there was no saving Marios progress) only to have to start over the next day because mom turned off the console... she just didn't understand, ""I made it all the way to world 5-3!!!"" Mario was a huge success for its time!!! There was nothing better!!! So, feeling nostalgic, I picked up a copy for my gameboy advance.

After a few hours of gameplay, I was done with it. In this day and age where games of the same price can be so much more entertaining... why did I blow my money on Mario? Its not that I expected cutting edge graphics, or changing the game (why change a classic. I would have been able to make it thru to the end if they just added one feature... just one. A simple thing like a save game feature would have given it 3 stars from me.

This is a perfect example of Nintendo recycling old games and making a bundle. No thought process went into this... it was an old idea repackaged. One thing this did for me, is made me appreciate the advancement in the video game industry.

I will agree that when Mario first hit the streets, it was the greatest thing out there. However at this point and time, Mario is definitly showing his age.

1.0,False,"08 1, 2011",ANNLCGS4PI9WX,B00006F7S8,John L. Guest,"This game was released about 2003 and developed over the 5 years prior to that. It also is completely unsupported by its ""owners"" EA (which bought it from Maxis)and has been for pushing a decade (it is a ""cash cow"" only). It is out of it's element on todays machines. The game is single-threaded and has its own scheduler. It is not well-adapted to a multitasking environment. It also can be rather snarky in getting along with some graphics cards. This means it has some real quirks and issues such as occasional failures to save, or lost cities, or ""crash to desktop"" (CTD's). On the other hand these can be countered by frequent saves and backups along with certain ""habits"" in the play methodology. If one does this, this game has some real appeal to many people.

The game was released as a core game, Simcity 4 (SC4) and an expansion, Rush Hour (RH) which in combination was dubbed ""Simcity 4 Deluxe"" SC4D. The Rushhour expansion used to be available seperately, but is quite scarce and/ or very expensive now&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SimCity-4-Rush-Hour-Expansion-Pack/dp/B00009V3NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SimCity 4: Rush Hour Expansion Pack</a>.

This particular release is only SC4 and frankly is essentially unusable by itself as much of the elements of the game, and much of the expanded customizable hooks, especially the ""networks"" part.. that part which handles the commuting and travel mechanics, allowing a wide array of ""transportation"" simulations. To be really useful you MUST (IMO) have the FULL set available in several forms (see below). My low rating is for THIS VERSION ONLY. I really quite like the game itself in its full, properly-registered form.

There also is a very active community, especially in the USA, Germany and Japan and lessor followings in many other countries. This group is very community oriented and supportive. Maxis was clever to embed into the game ""stubs"" which support a wide array of end user customization content, and this community generates active interest which carries the game well beyond its years. This group congregates on a half dozen or so ""support sites"" (all free) which are accessable by all. I'd estimate there are probably about a half million fairly active players worldwide.

The game is not played versus other players (other than in comparing accomplishments or progress or sharing custom content). It is a ""strategy"" game based on figuring out the operation and biases of the game and designing your city designs to best overcome and conform to these needs. There isn't ""an answer"" but rather a broad array of approaches that work to varying degrees based on what you are trying to achieve (dense ghettos, idylic contryside, sleepy towns, etc) A single ""regional development"" can easily take weeks to months of off and on attention to work through these issues. If these kinds of things appeal to you, this may be the game for you, just not in this version.

The game uses a copy protection scheme that requires the CD to be in the machine to play (or in the downloadable Amazon or Steam versions a running ""game support"" program that validates the game) Some folk are rather put off by this.

In summary, though this is still the core of the game, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. buy the full set.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SimCity-4-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0000C0YW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition</a>&nbsp;or the downloadable version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SimCity-4-Deluxe-Edition-Download/dp/B00457VJ3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download</a>] (also available via Steam) or as a subset of a box set with other games included&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-SimCity-Box/dp/B0014468XE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The SimCity Box</a>&nbsp;I have heard there are support problems with the patches on the box set, but don't  have personal experience with it. The downloadable versions should be ""pre-patched"".

Be VERY CAUTIOUS buying a used version from eBay, etc as you MUST have the registration membership in the EA/Maxis web site to update the game with it's patches.. only buy if you can get this membership with its User Name and Password included or certification that the serial number has never been registered... many people have been burned on this matter Even buying ""new"" versions is risky as many are just pirate copies of the game and the registration number will report ""already in use"" even though you ""bought it"" as ""new"". Get the seller to guarantee the version is register-able

Sorry to be so long-winded, but I felt most of this needed to be touched upon. In whatever form you buy it, I recommend immediately taking a look at web sites which have active communities interested in the game.

The second time I played, starting again from the beginning, it froze right at the start of the first fight scene... (during the dwarf's narrative)... so, when it just hung there, I started Task Manager to clear the game... AND IT WIPED OUT MY TASK MANAGER!! I mean totally wiped out!!

Why? How hard could it be to screw up a game franchise that was so successful? Just make the same game but improve the graphics. Why was that so hard? Why did this game fail so terribly?

Well, lets itemize what makes a great SWBF game and see where this miserable failure fell short:
1. Evolution: Does it hold up to and improve upon its predecessor?
2. Story - for folks who like to have a reason for going pew! pew!boom! instead of violence for the sake of it.
3. Authenticity: does it look and feel like Star Wars? Am I immersed in the setting?
4. Controls: are they intuitive?
5. Diversity: do I feel like I'm really a rebel/imperial/hero character/pilot?

Evolution:
Once upon a time, there was SW Battlefront II. It was awesome. It had an engaging story mode that told us the imperial side of the star wars story through the 501st Storm Trooper battalion. Voice acting and plot were solid. It had multi-player match making, galactic conquest, and multiple character classes---some ubiquitous, others unique to that army's faction. Vehicle controls seamlessly matched regular controls. Space battles were epic. Hero characters were highly effective.

This game has none of that. They removed everything good about the prequel and didn't bother replacing it with ANYTHING.

Story:
There is none. I'm not criticizing an existing story. They didn't even bother to make one. Wow. There are so many star wars books out there they could have borrowed material from anywhere but they just didn't

Authenticity:
I'll give this oozing lump of putrid mucous one thing: its a very shiny lump of putrid mucous. The graphics are beautiful and when I played I genuinely felt a part of the Star Wars universe, so A for effort here.

Controls: Just.... no. Its bad enough when you're trying to figure it out alone but when you're in a pitched battle? Forget it. Discover as you go. No tutorial. No story mode so you can get accustomed to the controls. No learning curve. Just a steep cliff. The controls for vehicles are a mess, assuming you even had time to figure them out before getting shot down or crashing unintentionally. And what's worse is vehicle controls are utterly alien compared to the foot soldier controls. They should be AT LEAST comparable.

Diversity:
a.) Foot Soldiers: One of the best things about SW BF 2 was the diversity of unit types. Engineers, foot soldiers, scouts, and heavy weapons troops could be chosen in any of the 4 factions, but their play styles differed enough to make them seem genuinely diverse. Battle droids had wrist rockets instead of grenades. Clone trooper blasters fire slower but more accurately than Imperial blasters while the latter enjoys a higher rate of fire. Armies had special units, unique to their faction and that added so much flavor to the game. In this iteration all playable classes are carbon copies of each other regardless of which side you choose. All weapon options are clones of each other too.  Bland. Boring. Next?

b.) Hero Characters: In SWBF2 hero characters were highly mobile, allowing you to evade and get into cover until you were ready for onslaught. They enjoyed defensive powers too, like deflecting enemy fire. Each came with a set of unique offensive powers too. My favorite was Force Push. In the early story I used it to one-shot General Grievous by chucking him off the ledge he dramatically drops down on when he shows up. Heroes were powerful! If you were stuck in a small room with Darth Maul, you were rightly doomed. It was great! But this game? The maps are too big so heroes are easily killed by just about any stumbling idiot with a blaster. Often times the excitement of becoming the mighty Lord Vader is quickly stamped out when you get headshot the instant you spawn. Heroes are worthless in this version of SWBF.

c.) Vehicles. This was the biggest letdown of all. When I saw land maps with air support, the chance to pilot an almighty AT-AT, I was practically drooling! But like everything else here, it was disappointment on a galactic scale. As aforementioned the controls were wretched. The air units exist only to provide suicidal fireworks for the folks below. And there was this cool Hoth battle concept where the rebels had to call in Y Wing Airstrikes against the ATATs before being overtaken. That sounds AWESOME but they somehow managed to RUIN it. first off there is no explanation on how the air strikes are summoned or the ATATs piloted. The whole map is one big flat piece of paper so tactical thinking like cover, terrain, high ground are all irrelevant. I just can't believe they went to the trouble of developing this game only to destroy every loveable aspect of it.

Characters are really dull and kind of annoying. Watchdogs 1 protagonist was a badass and as you start the game you would be beating up the bad guys. Watchdogs 2 characters are bunch of spoiled Silicon Valley kids patting each other on the back, so the missions are just about bunch a kids breaking rules, trying to have a good time.

They really wanted to make the game more stealthy but also have GTA V style action filled but utterly failed at achieving either. The most frustrating thing is the main character can't seem to be able to climb (these guys are makers of Assasins Creed). So you need to find the exact spot which you can climb over boxes to get to roofs. With all these stealthiness placed, there are not many stealthy take-out options. Shoot-outs are boring since infinite amounts of reinforcements just show up. you gotta use a stupid remote controlled car to do stealthy sneaks.

What really surprised me was fast travel was available right from the start of the game. So you just fast travel to mission spots, no real get a feel to the game missions.

Controls are not intuitive and really hard to get used to, specially while driving. Your lock on traffic lights, ppl, etc keeps switching so can't really do things you want to do. Aside from driving, controls for stealthy play is problematic too. You will find yourself clicking the wrong buttons and moving from your cover to exactly where you wanted to avoid.

Cop chases were what made me gave up the game. Cop cars just pop-in pop-out of nowhere. They seem to just know where you are all the time.  If you drive off the road they seem to be confused but again somehow they just pop nearby and see you anyway.

Another failed product by Ubisoft, I will start avoiding purchasing their games going forward. Don't buy this game.","Dull, boring and frustrating",1486771200,17,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

My wife likes games that are easy to understand, not too challenging, easy to play/win and fun enough to keep her interested for 45 minutes to an hour, at which point she usually gets distracted by something else.

Me, I can play games for hours.  I want a game that's difficult, challenging, and unique.  I like games that make me think, and challenges me to find new ways to complete tasks.

NEITHER of us liked Winter Sports on the Wii.  The controls are completely senseless, and have no relation to the task at hand, spare possibility the luge/skeleton/bobsled games which require nothing more than tilting a controller to keep the craft centered on the track.  The controls for speed skating made no sense whatsoever, and the curling controls were, in a word, stupid.  The controls for ice skating were so frustrating that we only played it once!  They simply had you jerking on the Wii controller and nunchuk attachment when icons for the two controllers reach a circle at the bottom of the screen.  The problem was, we could never get the controller to read accurately, and felt like there was a literal 1/10th second gap of opportunity to register the movement.  Very, very frustrating.

The other various subgames give you instructions on how to control the sport, but no indication of how to reach success in the game.  For example, it took a few passes down the bobsled track before we realized that you wanted to aim your craft for these light-colored strips impossed in the ice while a ""success bar"" would fill at the bottom, indication successful completion of each turn.  If we had been instructed in this method before our first time down the track, it probably wouldn't have been so frustrating.

The graphics look nice until you realize that there's little intelligence behind it.  During a two-player, speed-skating challenge, I pressed the Ready button, and both character figures on my split screen took a launch stance at the starting line.  My wife had not pressed the Ready button yet, and so both of the character figures on her split screen were still stretching.

I love the winter olympics.  I love winter sports.  But this game isn't worth it's value in melted plastic.  I'd have more fun falling repeatedly on my butt on an ice rink then playing this game for any length of time.

Out of the box, run the installer.  Everything looks good until it refuses to run because I have an ""emulator"" running.  Copy protection paranoia.  I go to the support site, and there is information about a combination of Dell and Roxio which trips this block.  I download the patch (even though I have an HP and Roxio) and the error message goes away.  Fortunately, I know what I am doing, but I feel for the average parent who just wants to get a game for the kids.

OK, patch installed, nothing but a black screen for over fifteen minutes.  The only way to get the game to start with the patch is to run the task manager and switch to the Lego Indiana Jones app.  Again, I pity the uninformed.

Once the game finally runs, there is no sound, only music.  The game plays, but the graphics are jerky and I have to turn the settings down (I have many games and a pretty advanced system, and this is the ONLY game I have EVER had to turn down anything on!).

At first, it insists that player one be the keyboard, while only player two may use the game pad.  Nothing would let me change that.  Today, I discover that whatever you touch when the game starts determines which control will be player 1.  Seriously!  Completely idiotic.  Nevertheless, make sure if you can run this game that you DO NOT TOUCH THE KEYBOARD WHEN THE GAME STARTS!  DO NOT EVEN TRY TO TURN DOWN THE VOLUME, AS YOU WILL BE STUCK USING THE KEYBOARD!

The gameplay, graphics, and music are nearly equal to the Star Wars ones, but the lack of sound effects is irritating.

If you really must buy this game, wait until we are done beta testing it and the patches are all available.

The experience with this game has made me re-think my pre-order for Lego Batman.  My son really wants that one, but he is frustrated with this experience too!

UPDATE:  After a long time of messing around to try to get sounds working on this game, I finally decided to give ""Run as Administrator"" a shot, and lo and behold, there be sound here!  Now the game is much better, but I renew my objection to both the ""emulator"" problem (I'm not running an emulator of any kind) and the fact that NO ONE at Lucas Arts had any idea how to fix this game!  Seriously, no one, and they wrote it!  Fortunately, I just happened to decide to try to run it as administrator, and the problem went away.

I have 5 level 80 characters of which one is a day from 85 and the others are all ranged dps so they will take about a week each to get to 85, since they all started in t10+ gear. So I have experienced every little bit of WoW short of the level 85 experience.

Whats wrong with Cataclysm ? Well, if you aren't a Goblin newbie, everything. The content is moderately interesting, but the quest engine is badly broken. Let me say from the outset that quite a few have completed all the quests in Vash, Deep, and Hyjal. But a huge number of players got halfway through the quest chain in both Vash and Deep and then could no longer find NPCs giving quests. The GMs say it is a known bug and is being worked on, but this means the only way to level pretty much is random dungeons. And these days, with so many in the same fix, the wait queue for a random dungeon team can run well over 10 minutes. For a healer!

And since questing has ALWAYS been the premier attraction of WoW expansions (only way you can experience the unveiling of the Lore) it is quite clear Blizzard really let us all down on this. Frankly, if you are just starting, just buy the base game, or even Wrath of the Liche King, which plays great up to level 80, and the quest chain works all the way to 80 and beyond.

However, even if I do not review it as a successor of one of my favorite RPGs -- Dragon Age Origins, it still has too many problems of its own. The companions are mostly stereotype characters without any development. Many people mentioned the reused dungeons but that was not the only problem. Those were cloned to the point that you may visit a ""new dungeon"" for another side quest and found it not only look identical to the one you just cleared. But you have to fight the same monsters and pick up random treasures at exactly the same locations.  Keep in mind that you have to revisit those dungeons over and over again in all 3 acts. Another issue is the item system.  It is worse than a 1996 action RPG called Diablo. In Diablo, random items are named based on its attributes. So for example if you see a ""King's Sword of Haste"", you know it does extra damages and comes with fastest speed. In Dragon Age 2, you may get many random items  under many different names with exactly the same useless attributes. This makes inventory management very tedious as it's hard to compare items and decide which ones to keep.  Also you get a lot of useless junks under many different names. So a lot of time would be spent picking up and selling all those useless items, some of which could actually have had some use to your companions but the game doesn't allow them to use most of them.  The side quests themselves are also very repetitive. Many of them are like go somewhere to kill a certain group of people, and you quickly find another identical one to kill a different group. Parts of the main quests also felt like partially copied from DA:O and just replace with a different character. It is very lack of originality. Playing this game feels like doing chores.  Sometimes I wanted to give up but continued in order to see the final ending. To my surprise, the ending was actually somewhat interesting. But I really have no interest of doing the same chores again. I guess the game probably started with an ambitious goal to improve on top of DA:O but instead cut many corners due to budget and release deadlines. It is very dissappointing that the story and characters are so boring that all the improvements(full voice, in some cases improved graphics) have been completely offset.  Also, I'm surprised a mature rated game for adult audiences would have such a flat storyline and characters.

To start off, the presentation of the game, specifically the menus, are cluttered and confusing. Then the actual graphics of the game are horrible, many games from the original Xbox look better than this. Maybe it's a false memory, but I almost think the graphics were the same or better in MLB 2k10. None of the players look anything like their real counterparts, even the most famous of players are unrecognizable in the game. The pitching is still the best thing in the game, although this time you can no longer pitch to the corners, as anything on the line is registered as a ball. There are some umpires in baseball that call the game like this, but it's very annoying in a video game. The hitting still sucks, it's very tough to tell whether a pitch coming in is a strike or a ball, and I can't feel the impact at all, it's very dislocated from the action. In the end, I always just felt like I was pulling a lever on a slot machine instead of swinging a bat. The fielding is maybe a little better in this iteration, but it's still frustrating how the AI transfers to human control, it almost always causes a hitch in the fielders gait, many times causing an error. Many of last years glitches have been fixed, but there are new ones in this years version.

Like last year, the best part of the game in my opinion is the My Player, as long as you play as the starting pitcher. However, it really wasn't changed at all. I'd love if there was more theatricality to the presentation, instead of an ugly menu popping up for every batter you face. It'd be great if there was more interaction with the players and the coach, For example: having the coach come out late in the game and ask if you're able to continue instead of stupid AI either taking you out after giving up a single which ultimately causes you to lose the game, or the AI keeping you in the game when you have no stamina left and they should bring in relief pitchers, also causing you to lose the game. Ultimately I'd like more RPG elements than just the boring menus and slow stat building.

The game itself is great, I haven't played a wrestling game since the SNES days.
The game controls are great arcadey fun, and deep counter system is implemented well, and as well has a great roster of characters.
The main reason you should stay away from this game is the load times.
Upon starting the game it has a memory cache' that take 5-10 mins just to get to the main menu.
This happens every time you play the game. Lets say you play WWE All Stars, quit and watch a movie listen to music or do anything else and go back, the game will cache memory again. You will not be able to just quickly jump into a match to kill 10-15 minutes, it takes 10-15 minutes before you even see gameplay. Its to the point that you wouldn't even want to play it, because you can actually play another game in the time it takes to load WWE ALL STARS.
There are load times between just picking you character in various modes, a load time before and after the entrances. There are load times everywhere, the load times are ridiculous.
If you plan on playing the game with some buddies later, you will have to plan ahead like 30 mins before any of your friends come over. I cannot recommend the game. The loading times in this game is the worst I've ever seen in the current generation. The load times will bore you to tears. Also the developers won't allow you to even install the game to cut down on the loading times via patch or update. I even wrote to THQ on whether or not they are working on it, and they say its by-design. By-design means they released a game that cannot be fixed. You will spend more time watching a loading screen than actually playing. You controller will go to sleep and disconnect because of the loading times. I have other fighting games MK9 SSF4 Tekken etc, with graphics just as good or better than WWE All Stars and those games loading times are nothing. You can almost play and beat arcade mode on SSF4 in the time WWE ALL Stars even gets you to the main menu. This is one of the most fustrating games I played this current gen, to a point where I will not ever buy a game from THQ ever again. This game need a warning label on the game stating: ""your enjoyment of this game will be severly affected by the by-design load times. THQ Releases games that are incomplete.""

The only enjoyment I really had with the game is Me and my buddies had a drinking game. You take a drink every time a load screen comes on and/or when a loading screen changes with in a loading screen.
You will be plastered by the time you get to the character select screen, because it loads when you move the cursor to pick a character as well.

Unfortunatly this is one of the most uninteresting games i've ever played.  I pretty much exclusivly play rpgs and i was just totally bored about 10 minutes into this game.  The plot is pretty much just meeting some schmuck on the road and he tells you something to do, so you go do it, and kill things along the way.  I mean come on...that was pretty fun at first but after Diablo, Diablo 2, and the numerous clones they spawned; that sort of thing has kind of gotten old.
You can only play as a human character and theres very few modifications you can do to your characters looks (and all of those modifications are abhorantly cheesy looking).
The advancement system is pretty simple, and i think thats why its boring.  If you want you character to be good in melee weapons; then you smash things with a sword.  Want an archer?  shoot things with a bow then.  Want character who can smash and shoot?  then smash things with a sword half of the time and shoot with a bow the other half.
But the thing that really made me hate this game was the camera angles.  They jammed so many stupid trees and caves and mountains into the screen that you cant see ANYTHING.  you have to spend about a minute moving your camera around before you can see anything, giving yourself an epileptic seizure in the process.  I found it easist just to play the game completly in the ""mega-map"" mode.  In that mode all the silly graphics don't get into your way and you can actually see where you're going.  But of course in the map mode you reduce the game to commanding a dot around and telling it to kill things.
The game did suprise me on how smoothly it ran.  Usually microsoft games give me alot of trouble with choppy graphics and game crashes.  But this one never crashed and was plesently smooth and fast.  Figures that the only game they make the runs smooth is the one i'm not interesting in playing...

- game freezes more than any other or recent memory (other than FarCry2's corrupted saves problem).
- story is dumb.
- combo button moves are childishly stupid and reduce the game to button mashing.
- i could never get the controls solid and ended up killing people i am supposed to consume half the time (in most games, right trigger is some form of attack, in this game it's sprint? except when you're in a vehicle? but not when you have a gun? ya...confusing...or just stupid.)
- stuff, enemies movie so fast, knock you down so often, you can't get your bearings and end up having to run around like a stupid chicken with your head cut off.
- the ""powers"" don't really make any sense. why does he have a blade growing out of his hand? why can he make a spike go underground? odd powers can be cool (shooting bees out of your arm in bioshock), but here it just seems silly and not story-driven.
- trying to survive in a helicopter with other helicopters around attacking you seems impossible.
- auto-targeting is GTA-style, ie, not good.
- map is ugly and uninspired.
- getting ""disc is unreadable"" errors now. lovely. the disc looks brand new and spotless. POS. Been on the same ""guys like phones"" or whatever it's called mission for an hour now to too freezes and dumb disc errors.

There is next to no end game content outside of raiding. Professions are gutted and almost no longer matter. The Garrison is worse then flying. It took everyone out of the world and put them into their own phased plot they never have to leave. Honestly you can level up inside your Garrison and never leave it. That is a broken system.

""Spoiler Alert"" Please do not read on if you do not want to know about the story.

It ended so bad. We didn't even have the end boss we expected. It was Archimonde not Grom or Gul'dan and after the fight after all the people Grom killed and after all the damage he caused it was like all was forgiven. He yells Draenor is free end everyone cheers and celebrates with him. He should have been brought to trail and punished for his crimes. So none of any of it makes a lick of sense. Worst of all I didn't care about Draenor or any of the worlds characters other then Maraad from out timeline who lost his life in a not very memorable way. Yrel should have died... Not him.

The story is just so broken. It is very obvious Blizzard stopped work on this expansion early. I can only hope for everything Warlords has lacked. Legion the next expansion will make up for. Seriously do not start your WoW experience playing this expansion. Stop at Mists of Pandaria or wait till the release of Legion.

If you start here there is a good chance you will put it down and never pick it back up and that just isn't fair to do to yourself. WoW was a great game. Warlords of Draenor just missed the mark and Blizzard can do better.

One final note... The high scores here tell me and I want to confirm. The leveling experience is great. It is very enjoyable and a well told story as you progress. Trouble is it is super linear and has little to no replay value. So again if a player has had Warlords a few days to weeks expect high ratings.

I gave this game a chance because I'm an avid Harvest Moon fan and I like Natsume. First, I know that this is not made by the ""traditional"" harvest moon game.

1.0,False,"09 1, 2010",AU4BS4T7B3HHB,B002BSC4ZS,Frederick Heind,"I bought this game with an open mind,knowing that it was going to be different from others in the series. I don't mind that,I don't mind change in a series such as this, I view it as a good thing assuming it is done well. So when I read negative things about this game, I erroneously assumed that it was just die-hard fans of the series that just couldn't accept the change, and that their bias led them to overlook a good game. I was wrong. Very wrong; The game just isn't that good.

The game starts with some very nicely rendered FMV scenes complete with voice acting (barring comparatively minor sound bites, this is the first Nintendo game to feature voice acting, meaning it has an actual script) however the voice acting is average at best in the game,bordering on horrible for certain characters.

Without spoiling too much, Samus answers a distress signal from a space station, and while there happens upon her old buddies from her squad in the galactic federation, including her former commander. These are terrible characters with no personality,as well as being so unbelievably generic as to be indistinguishable form one another, except of course the black guy and the asian guy, who are so stereotypical it's laughable.

In past Metroid games,as you explored the world(s),you would find along the way,various upgrades,namely new beams for Samus' arm-cannon,grappling hook,as well as upgrades to her suit itself. This was a staple of the games as well as the characteristic music that would play when you found those items.

That's where this game falls apart completely. This game throws away that classic colleciton aspect, in favor of a premise so outrageously stupid and contrived that it completely spoils the game and casts a veil of absurdity over the whole thing. It is This:As you arrive on the spaceship,and meet up with your old gang,it is made apparent through a cut scene that the commander has authority over Samus,who has all her abilities available to her, but she agrees to only use them as he authorizes them,and accordingly they are dispensed every so often as their immediate need arises. This is is just a horrible idea that is executed even worse. Samus is always fighting somehting in this game so why wouldn't she want to be well equipped, and why wouldn't her commander want her to be well equipped?Even more ridiculous yet is you must await authorization of the Varia suit which serves no purpose other than to protect Samus from extreme heat in the lava areas. So she won't turn on a feature to prevent her flesh from melting just because it isn't authorized. Among the game are other examples of that nature. I know it doesn't really effect the gameplay really, but as I said earlier it paints the game in such a ridiculous light that it's very hard for me to get over it.

Onto the controls:In the 3rd person perspective aspects, you hold the Wii remote sideways, which actually works very well, considering you are using a 2 pad to control Samus in 3d. Her movements are very fluid and easy to pull off which is nice. However that is only half the game, the other half is first person. At any given time when you flip the controller and point it at the screen, it shifts into a first person view from Samus' perspective. You can aim up and down and 360 degrees but you can't move around, as if her feet were cememented to the spot. This actually works well alot of the time, allowing for a unique novelty. Unfortunately there are other times where the action is just way too frenzied and there are too many enemies around for this to be practical and I found myself taking damage during the switch because there just wasn't enough time to aim and fire. Also for some ridiculous reason you can only use missles in first person.

There are some  very annoying segments that bothered me alot; one of them is when you finish a cutscene, you will sometimes be locked into first person mode, and you can't move until you find a particular object and scan it, sometimes it is so particular it is almost impossible to find.

Another is that occasionally there are some 3rd person segments which do not control like the rest of the game; the camera zooms up behind Samus, and her speed is reduced to a crawl; she may not jump or shoot even. Just walk around. These segments are wholly unnecessary and why the developers included them at all is a mystery to me.

The sad thing is that those problems aside, the game is great. It's very fast paced and the action is excellent, and the graphics, while certainly not the best, can be very vivid and pleasant to look at, with some very pretty areas. The music is somewhat bland I guess but it never becomes annoying. The tragedy is that had the things I complained about been removed, as well as with perhaps scrapping the first person view altogether, this would have been a really great game, but with them, it's basically unplayable.","Would have been a good game, but several horrible design choices render this title unplayable.",1283299200,32,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1.0,True,"02 26, 2015",A39I39HH8LM8UP,B00HZE2PJS,Eirkr,"I have a Logitech G710+ Cherry Brown version, the LED lights started going out this week, so I thought it's time to consider a new keyboard. I love the Cherry Brown switches, but the price is way up there so I decided to try something a little different. I did my fair amount of research on these Kailh switches compared with the Cherry ones, my findings tell me that they are a green light to go so I bought one. Now, I am using this keyboard with Kailh switches. I have to say, they feel exactly the same as the Cherry switches. I read something about inconsistency with activation pressure, but the factory specs on the Cherry had the same deviation as the Kailh. In actual use, these feel just as good as the Cherries. From my research, Cherry switches break just as often if not more often than Kailh and replacing them is a huge hassle... But the likely hood of having one break is super low.
The only problem I have with this keyboard is a minor quality control issue. For an $80 keyboard, anyone with the right mind would expect high quality. The caps lock key on mine has some finish issues that produced color tone deviations on top of the key. I looked everywhere and it seems I got a lemon. But this does make me question Thermaltake's quality control process and what their threshold is on a high end product. I have seen QC issues on their heat sinks before, but didn't expect this to happen to this keyboard.
I'm hoping the LEDs will last and so will the switches. Overall, the keyboard seems to be of a solid build. Don't count on the warranty as it will cost you weeks and shipping fees that probably end up wasting you more than going through the hassle. So, expect a product to at least outlast its warranty, that's what the manufacturer aims for too. With this keyboard, it is five years. I have had older keyboards that lasted over ten years, so I hope this one will last at least five.

I will try to update this review six months from today. And do note, reading the actual Warranty card inside the box: The fine print states this keyboard is covered under a 2 year warranty instead of the 5 on the packaging box sticker (for the certified mechanical switches). So, if you ever want to consider the warranty route, it really is 2 years for the keyboard, not 5. Looking into the warranty further, nowhere on Ttesports' website can you find a link to contact support for warranty, neither does Thermaltake's website have a system setup for easy RMA if this keyboard while in warranty. Click contact us on TTesports, takes you to a generic comments page dated 2010... On Thermaltake's website, contact us takes you to an e-mail address to email their customer support in Taiwan. Seems like this company is not ready for the global market or they just do not want to stand behind their product after they take your money.

02.27.2015 UPDATE ---

I contacted customer service and Amazon sent me a new one. So I did get a lemon on the first one. The caps lock on the new one is absolutely flawless. Check your keyboard for QC issues when you receive yours! Other than that, only time will tell if this keyboard will last.

02.28.2015 UPDATE ---

Ok, this is scary. I have used the second keyboard for a few hours now. Numbers 12345 on the numberpad started to intermittently go out, completely out. The mechanics seem to be functioning just fine, but 12345 stopped registering, while 6789 worked fine. Replugging does not always fix the problem but interestingly enough, cycling the LED brightness level a few times make those keys came back to life. I would assume there is some circuitry problem inside. This gives me way less confidence about this keyboard's quality.

I tested the anti-ghosting today, all the 8-key combinations I can think of registered all inputs precisely. Very impressive there. I have tested this on many gaming keyboards before and a lot of them couldn't handle most of my simultaneous key combinations outside the WASD zone. But plagued by the issues found above, I am having a lot of doubts about this keyboard being a high end gaming keyboard.

Since the warranty is almost non-existent as far as I can research it, I can only hope this keyboard would last at least two years...","OK Cherry MX substitute, but plagued by QC issues and warranty is questionable.",1424908800,10,"{'Size:': ' Brown Switches', 'Style:': ' Standard'}",

Though i haven't wrote many reviews so im kind of knew at this. im starting to now because i have a solid collection of rpg titles that i would love to write reviews for. I actually just recently played this game, yes i am a retro gamer and i play old games when i get around to it. This just happens to be one that i wanted to play so i can get my hands on magna carta 2 for the xbox 360. Which btw i will be writing a review on that game as well. Anyways lets start.

The story line of magna carta is bout as generic as you can get. Most of the first 20 hrs of playing, involve rescuing this girl named ""reith"". She ends up becoming so under lvled because she is constantly kidnapped through out the game, which is really agitating to me. The story does evolve a little bit and gets a little more interesting, at around the 30 hr mark. Close to the end of the game. But if your really a die hard jrpg fan, you may find some fun in this. Because it does have those traditional jrpg elements that most jrpg games have such as exploration of towns, taking to npcs, etc. I will say the game follows a very straightforward linear path. There is a map layout in which you can select where to go, much like most games now a days.

The battle system can be challenging which for people that like a challenge, may find it interesting to an extent, but it does have its share of problems. You can use up to 3 characters on a battle field, your able to see the monsters on the field before you fight them. So you can execute a preemptive strike which gives you bonuses and an advantage in battle. Or you can be surprised by the enimes, and your stats and stamina charisma gauge ends up being reduced. Before i get ahead of my self, let me explain this ""charisma guage"" This is basically your gauge to determine when your able to attack. Each of your allies and the monsters both have these gauges. Like wise if you go into a battle with a higher lvl monster, then there gauge will be higher, over lapping yours and you will get your ass kicked. When you have a higher charisma gauge, you can perform alot more attacks before the other monsters get to have a turn. The combat system relies on using different arts to perform special attacks. Its very different system then your average turn based strategy system. Well you do have to wait your turn, before your charisma guage fills up, you can freely move around the battlefield. Think of Eternal sonata. Its very similar to that type of style. The difference is though though, when you attack, a ring appears on screen, you have to press the corresponding buttons at the right time to finish the combo. Some of these can become a nuesence because the combo chains are pretty difficult to pull off. Also when the other opponent gets to attack, it can completely throw off your combo chain. I have ran into more then a few glitches with this type of combat system. This is probably the only thing in the game that like the most though.

The graphics and art style are very unappealing to me with very little coloring, most of the dungeons, towns all have the same similar look to them. For a game like this, i would expect something more along the lines of FFX or even wild arms would be pleasing to me. But this games graphics almost have a very dark pix elated look to them. Like its from one of the older ps one games. One of the most annoying things in this game and probably everyone aggree's with me here. Is that battles don't respwn. Once you clear an area, you can't go back to grind with out hitting certain mile stones in the story, this kind of creates a very linear experience. Another thing is the use of quests that you can get from weapon smiths, that tell you to go out and gather materials so you can upgrade weapons. Sure this is a very fun experimental aspect in rpgs that have been used so many times like the star ocean series, tales series, etc. I swear to god, i hit like 35 hrs in the damn game and i have yet to be able to gather the mats needed to finish those quests. I mean that is just ridiculous. Why put quests at the start of the game when you can't even finish them. Considering that monsters don't re spawn and you can't backtrack as much. This becomes a real hassle to keep your party strong. Whats more, is you can't take on two quests at once, your only limited to one quest at a time. So i actually found my self stuck in the game to where i could not backtrack to a town and cancel the quest, so i can take on the new quests of which i did have the mats for.

Another thing is the voice acting is absolutely horrendous, ive played alot of games but i don't think any game comes close to how bad the voice acting is. Maybe ""arc rise fantasia"" but thats bout the only game that i can think of that has worse voice acting then this game. In short though, the cut scenes don't really make you feel immersed in the story line as much because the voice acting is just down right terrible.

Like i said if you are a die hard core rpg fan that wants to get there hands on every jrpg game out there, you may find some fun in this game and its a bit more challenging then most run of the mill jrpgs. But trust me, if you looking for anything remotely close to series like tales, star ocean, level 5 games, like dragon quest. Look else where.",Best stay away from this one,1311120000,2,,

First, there is no resell (or trade-in) value, which doesn't really matter as much to me since I wasn't planning on selling it, but it does matter to a lot of people.

Second, we're at the mercy of Sony for how long we can play the expansions when it is not on disk, because there will be a day when they pull the servers.  And if you don't think they will, look to Live support on the old Xbox, which was a service with paying customers.

Third, there is absolutely no added benefit to buying the Game of the Year edition unless you own no parts of the game.  For me, who own Borderlands and one expansion, it'd cost more to buy this version than 3 more expansions, at no added benefit.  For many Xbox Live users, they had the opportunity to download most of the expansions at 50% off already, so a copy of Borderlands with 50% off expansions is potentially only $50, and that's assuming a new copy of Borderlands.

I got into Borderlands later than many, and bought one DLC before hearing rumors about a Game of the Year edition.  I decided to wait, because I thought if I waited, I would basically be able to have the game and expansions on disk, which would enable me to play them 10 years from now.

However, this is obviously not the case, because the game disk is identical to the normal version.  The only difference is that it now includes a single code for all the expansion packs.  So if you already have one or more, like myself, you can't even give away the expansion pack you already have.  Instead, they essentially make you pay double for the same download content.

The only actual benefit of this release is the map, and the Duke Nukem Forever early access demo code.  As someone who had already played many hours of Borderlands, that's not worth shelling out $60 for.

I was very excited when it first arrived on the market and thought it would be fun having a new town and farm to play on a portable handheld. But unfortunately, this game turned out to be absolutely terrible and a huge miss that just gave more evidence that Harvest Moon has fallen way downhill since it's heyday on the Nintendo 64 and Playstation.

First of all, the farming is basically torture. Not only do you have to build your own barns but they can fall down and all of your animals can die. You have to be kidding me. There is absolutely no way playing with this system could be fun. It is just stressful and too much work for a game that used to be so relaxing to play on a calm day. I did enjoy the addition of having a cat and dog and I thought the layout and look to the farm was nice. Really, it all does look nice graphically wise. Forever Not Valley looks rather cute and clear on the Nintendo DS and I liked all of the graphic sprites. But this does not take away that the town has no substance whatsoever. The characters are absolutely boring compared to previous titles and I have no urge to be friends with any of these people besides that they look cute. They are one dimensional and if they appear to have conflicts in the beginning of the game, they never come to surface or change. Yawn.

As proof that characterization has gone down since the original games, I will compare this game to Harvest Moon 64 and Friends of Mineral Town. Lumina is my favorite girl in this game and Karen is my favorite in Friends of Mineral Town and 64.

Nintendo 64 - Karen
The most memorable heart event was saving the vineyard after your effort! Karen comes over to your house to invite you over to see fairies kissing the fruit and begins to dance because she is just so overwhelmingly happy. It is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in a video game. Not to mention, Karen was full of depth. Her father was an abusive alcoholic, the family business was poor until you help, she longed to live in the city, etc.

Friends of Mineral Town - Karen
The most memorable heart event was when Karen discovers that her father had bottles of wine stored for her as a baby. You must go to the neighbor's vineyard to help her carry them back home. When you get back she gives you a bottle as a gift. While is not nearly as special as the previous, I found it to be rather cute and unique! In this game Karen is not nearly as feisty but enjoys wine, is good talking with others, and is a romantic.

Forget Me Not Valley - Lumina
All of her heart events consist of a DVD player. Yes. A DVD player. How romantic. She is nice and sometimes she likes to plays the piano.

A Harvest Moon game with no characterization just takes about half the fun out of the game. This combined with the boring and long tedious farming system makes this game a waste! Please do not waste your time on this game.",I will never purchase another Harvest Moon game.,1375920000,,,

I used to know a guy who went through BUD/S (SEAL training) years back, and he would say that if you take a bullet by one of these big guns, you are going down fast. Yet it takes 20 bullets to down any guards, unless it is a head shot at close range. Ubisoft definitely dropped the ball on this one. Mark this one: AVOID.

The graphics are on par with the early days of the PS2 and not what I have come to expect.  From the 3 levels that I could stomach I found the controls choppy,  the interaction between Eragon and Brom non exsistent and ultimatly found Brom to be quite a useless partner when taking out any enemy.  9/10 his bow shots miss and he rarely ever quickly finishes anyone off leaving you to do most of the work.  From what I read in the book it was Brom who constantly saved Eragon not the other way around.  Methods of healing are few and far between.  most times you find yourself going through check point after check point toughing it out with what little health you start with.  the cut scenes between each level do nothing to really help the story but as an excuse to not reveal too much information about the story itself.  Quite early in the story Sapphira helps out in a big way and her part in this story I have yet to see other than the reason that the entire story picked up.  Had I not read the book I can easely see myself not really caring about any of the characters and generally wondering, ""Why am I wasting my time with this?"" coupled with ""Thank God I rented instead of buying.""

The only explanation would be that this was the first game they picked up from the story because this was, by far, the worst AC game I've played. EVEN WORSE THAN THE FIRST ONE.

Where to begin:

1. Game play - Obviously they were thinking, I don't know what the hell they were thinking. The combat mode was horrible, it took many, many steps backwards. They should find out the combat mode from Batman and use that because this was inferior. Also, there were many times that the buttons wouldn't pick up a weapon or the cities would be moving very slowly.

2. The story - went to complete crap, I was very disappointed in what happened. When the second game came out you were sucked into the story, you felt that it was talking to you and you could be sucked into it. With this, it seems to be contradicting and boring.

Pros: Far Cry in 10,000 BC which some unique game play elements with animal taming.
Some lighting improvements within the graphical areas, but more or less the exact same as Far Cry 4.

And that's about it. The Cons:

* The story is non existent and the fun antagonists we have seen from Far Cry 3 and 4 is very weak as a result as well.
* Yes it is the stone age, however, the lack of weapon variety which has made Far Cry a staple, or at least differentiated gameplay and mechanics during the game itself, is horrible to the point where boredom sets in very easily.
* The animations and gameplay elements (Aside from weapon variety) are the exact same and copy pasted from Far Cry 4.
* The crafting system hasn't changed, although one can take from this that it is more survival than anything else. While it is a twist, it doesn't help when it comes to balance. The weapons from earlier ranks are sometimes more powerful than their upgraded counterparts.
* Some of the water/particle effects are very poorly done and it's very offsetting in some pocket areas.
* The characters you interact with throughout the game are boring. While they tried to do something here by giving them their own language and subtitling the communication for the gamers to understand, there is nothing of substance.
* A wasted opportunity by not going completely fictional with the time frame and adding dinosaurs (Yes I know, they were extinct in 10,000BC. But the story line is so weak. If it came down to pacing or realism, I doubt Cavemen are riding sabertooth tigers or seeing through the eyes of an owl) - So adding dinosaurs here (Even more hilarious would be able to control them and have your T-Rex eat villages) would have been outstanding and severely had the game overcome the horrid story arc.

In the end, this is a reskin of Far Cry 4 with limited carryover from what made Far Cry 4 (Or 3 for that matter) fun and engaging games. Something like this should have been a DLC purchase for Far Cry 4 at it's best, and to think they are selling this at full price after 15 months of development, it's easy to see why the game wasn't more. This was a very low cost effort from Ubisoft, and quite frankly, they should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this as a full retail priced game and essentially screwing over their customers.",Nothing more than a $19 DLC reskin of Far Cry 4.,1456358400,33,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It's a hard formula to mess up. But god bless em', Codemasters found a way. They actually managed to make a game based on pillaging, destruction, and outright chaos...boring. And that's exactly what Overlord II is, it's boring.

The original featured fun quests, original content, unique and interesting puzzles and tons of replay value. The sequel has none of these. Instead, quests are replaced with some of the most mind numbing goals imaginable. For instance, one of the VERY FIRST QUESTS you receive is simply this: ""Kill 1000 Gnomes"". Ahh, okaaay?

Next is your minions, specifically controlling them. The control scheme in the first game was as close to perfection as it gets. It was solid, your minions did what you told them to do and so on. In O2, controlling your minions is an outright pain in the a$$.

This is now a NEGATIVE 5 star review!
I thought that, ""Hey... It's been over half a year since I last played this game... Maybe, just maybe... Blizzard fixed the stupid Skirmish A.I. and the game might be fun now..."" Boy was I wrong, as I cannot even play the game anymore because of blizzard treating its paying customers as if they were criminals. They might as well ask for a fingerprint and D.N.A. sample before being able to play. Maybe I need to take a test of some sort before they deem me worthy to play a game I PHYSICALLY OWN! Hell the C.I.A. and F.B.I. websites have less log-in requirements than this freaking game.

I have to REMOVE ALL STARS because this game is no longer playable due to the sheer amount of loops needed to jump through just to play OFFLINE SINGLE-PLAYER!!! There is nothing wrong with my FIOS fiber-optic connection! There is nothing wrong with my firewall! There is no reason to have to activate a game (for the sixth time!!)

I CANNOT PLAY THE GAME AT ALL IN ANY MODE!! I cannot even log onto the game as a GUEST on my own computer! I DON'T EVEN PLAY MULTI-PLAYER!! Why the bleep do I need to log onto 3 different places to play OFFLINE SINGLE-PLAYER!?!? This is beyond ridiculous!

If this is their idea to try and stop piracy, then they failed, because this kind of treatment of PAYING CUSTOMERS just drives PC piracy through the roof.

If there is any class action lawsuit against blizzard, or way to return the game, please let me know because I want my $60+ dollars back!!!
!!EDIT #3!!

I just got the retail release... Been waiting 10 years for this... I have to say it is more hype than it delivers on. Yes the controls are still nice and simple, I enjoy that a lot... But it just seems to be Starcraft 1 minus the brood war expansion, with a bit better graphics thrown in. Forgive me for being blunt and critical with this but THEY HAVE HAD OVER 10 YEARS TO MAKE THIS GAME!!!

First off the price was outrageous, but like an idiot fanboy I shelled out $60 bucks for 1/3rd of a game... Considering that this is only the Terran campaign and that the Protoss and Zerg campaigns will not come out for over a year from now, and they will cost an additional $60 each, as far as I know at the moment! Though there are rumors they may be expansion priced at $20 a pop (in all honesty they should be FREE Down-Loadable-Content since it should have been in the game from the beginning!). So Blizzard is becoming even more greedy than EA. Sure when EA releases a game it's too soon, half-a$$ and buggy as all hell, but at least it is mostly there. Blizzard, on the other hand releases a game, a million years after the first game, fully polished and de-bugged, but missing 2/3rds of the gameplay and no big improvements over the original!

The game runs fine on ultra settings for me with vista ultimate x64, 8gigs of ram, and an Nvidia 9800gtx+ card, but I am a bit disappointed considering there has been over 10 YEARS of 3D RTS advancement from the original Starcraft... What I mean is: You CANNOT rotate the camera, only zoom in and out a little bit so sometimes trying to click on one unit in a group of many is a nightmare. You CANNOT rotate the placement of buildings so everything is always facing only one direction, not that bad but units still come out of the sides or backs of buildings through walls instead of the front door... The is NO anti-aliasing support, not that bad, but my computer is a gaming rig. So compared to the older Command & Conquer Generals, or the newer Command and Conquer 3, or Supreme Commander and many other RTS games out there already; this game is actually BEHIND the times in graphics and 3D battlefield control.

One of the worst things is the online requirement... But fortunately it is only checked occasionally so this can still be played offline with a laptop, but in that case you have to log on as a ""GUEST"" for a game YOU OWN on a computer YOU OWN! But BEWARE, when you register the game they ask you VERY PERSONAL THINGS, like: name, age, sex, location, telephone number, and even your street address! And you HAVE to fill it out or else you cannot play the game!

Now for the gameplay... It is just as awesome as the first Starcraft! I am having a blast with it... But that is because this is JUST LIKE the first Starcraft, some of the levels feel like they just took them from the first game and threw in more eye-candy. If you LOVED BASE BUILDING then keep playing the original Starcraft, because this game seems to have been made for the A.D.H.D. And A.D.D. generation, too many levels are small and set with a TIME LIMIT... Come-on Blizzard! You can do better than tiny little 10 minute levels... Though there are still some large maps and unlimited time levels for us base builders. But I miss the huge levels from Broodwar and the original Starcraft where you would have to send out search patrols all over the map to find that last enemy building or objective. I think they spent more time on the cut scenes and in-between game down time than the level design and map sizes, some of the levels feel downright cramped claustrophobic. There are some new, and quite AWESOME units in this game, but there are also lots of missing favorites from the Broodwar expansion. Though one of the new elements I find interesting is the downtime between missions where you can purchase unit upgrades, talk with crew members ""Point and click"" style, and choose the next missions a bit less linear than the first Starcraft, so it has a bit of RPG elements thrown in. They have also jumped onto the whole ""Achievements"" bandwagon so you get these annoying popups now and then that apparently give you bragging rights online or something like that. When you get these achievements, they don't actually do anything that I am aware of in the game other than unlocking portrait pictures for the forums online community.

This game gets 5 STARS for fun because it is just as fun as the first Starcraft, but... It only gets 2 STARS overall for the fact that in over 10 years they could only give us 26 missions in ONE PLAYABLE CAMPAIGN, and slightly updated game-play graphics (one of my friends couldn't tell the difference between the original Starcraft and this one), while taking away LAN play, taking away some favorite units, and jumping on the ""ALWAYS ONLINE"" and pointless achievements intrusive bandwagon.

I loved the original Starcraft to death, so I honestly thought this one would be a bit more updated compared to the original. It is still a very fun game, but I would say... Wait a few more years for a game of the year edition, or a reduced price box-set with everything included, unless Blizzard nickel and dimes its fans to death first.

*edit #2*
Player vs. A.I. is completely messed up, the A.I. does not even make base defenses until 30 minutes into a match and even then it makes only 3 and in a weird place. A.I. also attacks the entry to your base that is nearest to the A.I. base and completely ignores undefended points of your base if they are farther than your main entry point. A.I. also just creates a large mass of units and sends them all at once making the A.I. very easy to defeat with even bad units. Multi-player and VS. A.I. has a lack of unit types, basically half of what you got in the campaign. Every day I play this, it feels more like a still in development beta release.

I will continue to update this review as things get worse or better over time.

The background:

I purchased this 1019 memory card when I bought my Wii.  I never had a Gamecube, so I thought I'd mess around with some Gamecube games due to the Wii's backwards compatibility.  Deceptively, with no issues, I played several Gamecube games on my Wii over the course of a few months.

Then I played F-Zero GX with 1019 on Wii.  From that point on, my 1019 was bricked and all my saves were lost.  Are certain games' save mechanisms not compatible with Wii/1019?  Is the Wii randomly introducing electric shock to corrupt the card?  The cause may not be known, but I have a $20 white brick.  It can't be formatted.

in monetary value. It is priceless considering i could have done literally ANYTHING other than play this mess of a game.
First off, i only bought it on the merit that it is a PS3 exclusive and since i missed out on the early PS3 days, i decided to give it a try despite all the bad reviews.

I'm sad to report that those bad reviews have been incredibly generous to the game. I can't blame the early reviewers because in 2007 when the game originally came out - they were stuck with the motion controls (patch was released to allow analog controls since) and i highly doubt that with such, they were able to beat the first few levels of the game.
Even now in 2014, with the ability to control your dragon with analog sticks, a lot of actions and game mechanics rely on motion controls which you can't avoid using which eventually causes the game to crash and burn on into a rubble of its own problems that are abundant and absolutely ruin the experience.

Story:

Standard affair fantasy world with dragons with forgettable characters (save for the main character Rohn), by-the-numbers plot development, and a cheesy ending (i assume - because i will not waste another second trying to complete this game). Poor man's Lord of the Rings. Substitute the one ring for VOLCANOES (LOL) and you'll see just how every single aspect of this universe is watered down, laughable middle-earth.

Graphics:

For 2007, i have to imagine that the graphics were quite amazing. It was an early HD console game so by today's standards it looks quite rough around the edges. Can't complain too much though as good graphics don't always make a good game.

Controls:

Horrendous. Easily a gamebreaker in this case. I can't imagine paying full price for this when it was new, only to give up 20 minutes in, after finding the game is unplayable. With the new patch, it helps matters a little bit, but the motion stuff is still unavoidable.

Gameplay:

The control paragraph sums it up pretty much but i'd also like to add that the mission design is one of the most ill-advised, badly-executed and schizophrenic affairs i've ever had the displeasure of partaking in. First off, the game often contradicts itself, it can kill you on a whim, it can randomly decide you've failed a mission, the missions are reptitive and you'll very quickly get bored of maniacally tapping on X to make your dragon go faster and square to make your dragon shoot fire/ice. There are some laughable quick-time events as well that don't work half the time. Its a jumbled mess full of baffling design choices that makes you think the developers never made a game before. All in all, it can get intense and interesting but that makes up 10% of the missions you'll partake in with 90% being frustration, regret for buying this game and a huge desire to put the disc in a toaster.

Overall:

Glitchy, buggy, truly horrible experience that probably never went through quality testing.
As a matter of fact, if i ever meet the QA department responsible for this mess, i'll demand reprimands for wasted time and frustration i had to endure playing it.
A true relic and a testament of PS3's horrible start to life almost a decade ago. I'm thankful i missed out on console gaming during that time, otherwise i would have never picked up a controller again.","Horrible, frustrating experience. Would only recommend to my oldest enemies",1387065600,,,

I wasn't aware of that. I knew newer games - like Rome II - are Steam driven, that's why I will never buy them. But I thought that NTW, a 2009-10 product, was still what most of PC games were for decades: a DVD (CD - and even floppy disks - before that) distributed software that you could install in your PC all by yourself. Then, since Doom II ages, if you wished and if you wanted, you could pick a multiplayer mode based on LAN first, and the Internet later. But it was always your choice, AFTER you had your game installed in your hard drive.

There is a specific - and abusive - reason you can't play anymore any Steam game from a LEGALLY bought USED media (DVD or whatever). Key word here is USED, meaning that the original owner HAD to register the game in Steam, in order to be allowed to play it, doesn't matter he/she bought it in DVD format.

After that happens, Steam does not provide any mean at all of making the game available to a second hand user.

I'm not talking here of two people (original and second hand owners) using at the same time one single license for the game, no.

What I find totally abusive and ill intentioned, is that Steam refuses to deactivate the original account, once a second person tries to register in Steam the same game license again. It doesn't matter that you provide them with proper proof of purchase, Amazon invoices and such. They ignore all that, and send you to SEGA customer ""support"". Once you reach SEGA, you are told plain and simple: we don't want you to buy a USED copy (at 11.99), we want you to buy a NEW one (at 54.99).

So where is all this scheme intended? Simply, to kill the second hand market of software.

To be fair I have to acknowledge the totally nice and sympathetic attitude of the reseller - ""Wonderbook"", whom, after I explained all this, refunded my money without even wanting me to send back the DVD package. I'm sure they took due notice and retired from their offer any other DVD game prone to suffer the same destiny: a waste of time (and money from the reseller part).","Don't buy an used DVD copy, won't be able to use it.",1381708800,5,"{'Edition:': ' Limited', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

You start out the game with two playable characters: Wolverine and the Human Torch.  You can unlock several other characters but it will require battle points.  You earn battle points by killing, killing & killing (as fast as possible).  The fighting environments are highly destructable, but more often that I'd care to mention, you'll find walls and floor simply disappear- the sprites are terrible & many times your character will be left simply standing in thin air.  The character animations themselves are shoddy- terribly choppy frame rate.

The cut-scenes in-between fights contain grammatically incorrect text.

I can't say anything positive about the fight mechanics either as the collision detection is horrendous.

In Sum:

Animations are choppy.

Sound is nothing bad/good, merely passable.

Fun factor is non-existent.

Did this game have potential? Absolutely. It had massive potential. The characters look nice and cartoon-like, there are more than 8, and you could play online at one point. But what is a game if the game play is less than sub-par?

The amount of content in this game is extremely lacking. You can win a few new characters but that's about it. There is a challenge mode but you must beat 22 people in 250 seconds. Those 2 things are your main things you can do in this game. As far as characters, you start out with Ken, Ryu, Bison, Sagat, Zangief, and Balrog... I mean who else does anyone care about in the SF universe enough to buy a game just to play them?

The fighting is somewhat fun but it has so many flaws it is ridiculous. The CPU you fight has what I like to term Metaknowledge where you can be inputting your Haduken buttons and already the computer is lifting up, coming down with an attack to dodge your fire ball and hit you in a combo that takes half of your life.

When you jump to kick someone, they can break from anything they are doing (anything) no matter how complex and stop to hit you out of the air because their timing is so precise you can't walk up to them, you can't jump to them and come down with an attack, and out of the blue if you are able to get in an attack from jumping it will be blocked, the bottom kick will be blocked, and you will be countered with a grab.

Metaknowledge in video games irks me to no end. The AI can hit you no matter what you are doing but they will dodge and block anything you do. Not only that, they will counter you with a 5 hit combo and top it off with their special move which they seem to charge up much faster than you. Pretty much 15 seconds and you're toast.

My main beef with the game is if you can get past all of the metaknowledge the game has, the last boss battle is against a creature named Seth. He is pretty much like the wooden guy from Tekken in that he is a mix of all characters in one. He can teleport, he can stretch his limbs out, he can shoot things at you, he can and will combo you like crazy. He will do the thing where he stands there until you are JUST at the nanosecond of standing up and he will attack you mercilessly to knock you down in which the cycle will repeat itself. He will counter any inch of a move you make and hit you with about 5-10 hits in each counter. Even on ""Very Easy"" he is still a struggle. So much so that there are videos online showing how you can turn the game on the easiest mode just to beat him.

Is that really how you want to remember a street fighter game? Where God willing you make it to the last boss you need to have it on the easiest mode you can have it on just to be able to stand a chance? So you have unenjoyable and frustrating fighting, a major lack of content, and a lack of reason to play as you will just be trolled like some bad joke the developers threw in for a final boss fight no matter what character you are playing with.

Virtually, with the lack of content and horrid game play, the only thing I commend this game on is its graphics...which is not enough to get me to play it because I'm here for game play.

When I first played it as a demo a year ago I immediately purchased it because of the fun community aspects and advanced and unique interactions within the game. I met many people in the game and developed many friends, worked tirelessly to advance my character, and had a whole lot of fun. For a guy who loves Star Wars and a guy who likes computer gaming, this game was fantastic. But all that changed on the dark day of April 28, 2005, when Sony Online Entertainment butchered this game in a weak attempt to lighten it up for casual players they hoped to draw in after Episode III.

I will not get into specifics, but suffice to say this so called ""Combat Upgrade"" tore the soul out of this game. A mass exodus of easily fifty-percent of the game's total playerbase commenced within the first few weeks of this patch- some of these players being veterans of the games who had been playing for nearly two years. Glitches were abound, balance fell apart, and it became so bitterly comical that my character, a pretty experienced avatar, fell dead to the killer sting of a butterfly in game. Combine this with the fact that some people's characters are irrefutably damaged, many of my personal in-game items including my home and weapons all disappeared, and the fact that this game is now nothing more than a 15 dollar a month exercise in futility and you'll soon realize that this is one game you don't want to own.

So be smart. Don't buy Star Wars Galaxies or its derivitives. It costs money to play, and there are more bugs and glitches in this game than in the first release of it back in August of 2003. It breaks my heart that I have lost so many friends and a great experience, but this game is truly forsaken. It is not the same game anymore, it is completely different.

This headset has provided me with no problems so far. The volume control is awesome and can be super powerful. The mic pics up my voice just fine and everything is clear. I have no problems using this while I stream.

The best thing one can say about this game is that it is a good idea, executed very poorly. As someone who is interested in the idea of using a sandbox game as a story-telling engine this game was a compelling purchase (though i still held off on getting it until i could purchase it for 3 bucks from the steam post christmas sale). Unfortunately after a few hours of playing it, i've found that what really lets this game down is the game. It over uses cut scenes (constantly usurping control), it handles like arse (regardless of your inclination to vehicles or being on foot) & the combat is ardious: Any game that requires me to pin point shoot a target sure as hell better give me a responsive enough set of controls to actually achieve the result.

But most damning is the fact that this game is not a open world sand box, so much as it is a rail shooter set on a open world sand box map. Apparently there are two ways to do every mission:
1. The way the game wants you to do it.
2. The way that restarts the mission so you can do it the way the game wants you to do it.

It's not always easy to admit, but in this case, I do so freely.  I prepaid for this ripoff, blissfully assuming that it would be worth the money.  It is not.  Yes, it is an enjoyable game, eventually, but not worth the price in truth.  It simply doesn't hold the power of the first to captivate and ensnare.  The theme is no longer original, and the story is a stretch.  Combat is passable, and bugs there are aplenty.  That of course is not the worst of it though.

When will these idiots realize that DRM does exactly nothing to stop piracy?  It was available on BitTorrent THE SAME DAY IT HIT THE SHELVES.  Nice job with that copy protection guys.  Wonder how much you paid for it.  Sure didn't stop the pirates.  What it DID do was irritate the hell out of anyone (like me) dumb enough to actually pay for your game.  The pay version is inferior to the pirated version.  Take 2 paid who-knows-how-much money for DRM that encourages people to pirate the game, because the pirated version doesn't have limited installs.  It doesn't require an Internet connection to play.  It isn't saddled with the horrific SuckyouROM.  And of course it's free.

As a contrast, consider Mass Effect 2.  Apparently, Bioware learned the lesson that Take 2 is obviously having trouble with.  Ironically, I obtained that game in an ""unorthodox"" fashion, assuming that it, like its predecessor, would be laden with DRM.  I was wrong.  Upon learning of this, I actually went to Gamestop and purchased a copy that still sits unopened on my desk.  That's right.  True story.  I paid for it, because it is a fine game with only the bare minimum DRM that requires a CD.  I find this reasonable, if slightly annoying.  Bioware deserved my business for their decision to not punish honest buyers.

Take 2 does not.

Music: While there are some familiar tunes such as the Tristram theme, it feels a bit tacked on. It doesn't have that gothic, foreboding feel that the original had. It seems like some other game from some other company. Since this was from Blizzard, my hopes were that it would topple the original Diablo AND Diablo 2. It doesn't. Very disappointed.

DRM: Always on. So you can't play it from a laptop, at least not that I know of. A fail on so many levels. Getting booted from the system multiple times a day. Having my items suddenly disappear when I relogin. It is just so underwhelming and breaks the ambiance every time this happens.

Gameplay: Uninspired. It feels like a completely different outlook than the previous incantations of Diablo. Most of the original Diablo guys have left for greener pastures. The gameplay itself is simply OK, but the dialogue feels...lax. It doesn't have a soul. If you have ever had the stomach to sit through Lucas's The Phantom Menace, well you'll have a good idea about the dialogue. Stomach churning. Story is pretty much what we could expect from Blizzard and the Diablo series. Kill Foozle, while losing various items and characters along the way.

It's essentially a dated, semi-professional Quake 2 mod, with the addition of a novel damage-modelling system that lets you shoot people's arms off. Made even worse by a useless attempt to give the game some authenticity - the box, CD, installation and loading screen are covered with warnings that the game is a realistic depiction of modern warfare, all of which exist purely as a tease, because the game itself is essentially a G.I. Joe cartoon with blood. The violence is strictly cartoonish - shoot somebody in the leg, and he hops around yowling - and the novelty wears off after a minute or so. Everything else about the game fails, comically so, from the interactive music (which, because of the game's lack of any slow bits, stays in 'combat mode' almost all the time, negating the point), to the 'stealth element' (make too much noise and bad guys appear in the level, usually in totally illogical places) to the interface, which looks as if it had been drawn by a backwards child. The gameplay itself is pure Quake 2 - you run through a linear track, along which bad guys are placed at regular intervals. Sometimes you have to press a button to open a door. If something moves, you shoot it. Most usually, nothing moves - the bad guys are, in the words of GameSpot, 'strawberry-jam-filled turrets'.

It really is sad when developers have such a good idea for a game but the end product falls short of fun and entertaining. I'm sure the fan boys out there are going to chew up my review for this but first, I don't think the movie Tron even made much of an impact at the box office. I think I first saw it in '92. I recently saw the game on the shelves and decided to give it a try.

The graphics of Killer App look  really good. Granted the levels each consist of one color  in a few different shades. None the less animation is smooth and I never incurred choppy graphics. Design of the levels, characters, weapons and light cycle all feel authentic. The sound is also well done especially with surround sound, but the bass was over done.

The game play was a poor experience. First of all the guns are horribly inaccurate do almost no damage except the sniper rifle. Unloading on your enemies quickly drains your energy level leaving you vulnerable and with only your disc as protection. Health also drains pretty fast. I am a huge fan of first person shooters and Killer App simply felt more like a platform adventure in a shooter engine. The enemies can be at the end of a vast stadium or expansive hallway and can hit you with bullseye accuracy from the first shot they fire. Thats fine, games are more fun when they're more challenging. However, most of the levels, you have to pay extremely close attention to your steps since you can easily fall off a catwalk to your doom; that takes away the tactical use of strafing and its just poor planning. The shooting part of the game makes for a frustrating experience since you WILL be swarmed by enemies with perfect accuracy and you have to juggle your attention between your energy bar, your aiming and your footing plus for the most part tracking down an objective you have no idea where to find and lastly the enemies that are respawning-think Halo legendary difficulty, with almost no ammo and no friends to help you.

Now I'm sure any huge computer dork would love the ability management system in the game. Not only is it poorly explained but its also another factor that holds back any fun in the game, as you have to aquire abilities and power them up. Why should that be so bad? because leveling up abilities DRAINS YOUR ENERGY BAR  leaving you with even less precious ammo to use against the waves of deadeye drones trying to air you out. I won't even go into the plot as it doesn't matter.

I suppose the only thing I actually enjoyed in the game was the light cycles. Before you get all excited, there is very limited use of the cycles in the game, in fact almost none. In all Tron 2.0 Killer App is a graphically noble attempt at the FPS genre. The short comings far outweigh its attempt. Heres a quick summary of the experience:

read boring vague menu, more vague menu, kill 5 drones, miss a step and fall to death, retry---and it just loops over and over like that. Of course if you're a huge fan of the movie and enjoy platform games and enjoy ""reading"" a video game rather than playing it, look for Tron 2.0 in your local game store's bargain bin.

And one last note to the fan boys that love this game, I read an article recently that says the director of ""The Princess Diares"" will be releasing a new Tron movie-so look for a mediocre movie to go along with the bland game.",Interesting  level designs,1110585600,2,,

Lots of cute new characters for those who liked the women of the RA series.  Supports high resolution gaming :).  Fun to run it at 1920 by 1200 with all effects set to maximum.  Good graphics compared to many other RTS games I have played.

That all sounds fantastic, but don't lose sight of the short (but VERY SIGNIFICANT) list of CONS:
--------------------------

*Limited Installations mean you don't really 'own' the game, you're just renting it at full price. (if you're buying a retail copy, and not a copy from Steam)

*SecuROM (again, assuming you're getting retail and not Steam) This SecuROM stuff that RA3 will install on your computer before you're able to play is BAD NEWS.  Many people have had serious difficulties with their computers after SecuROM has infested them, and apparently it is not very easy to get rid of once it has infested your computer.

*The RA3 Tanya just wasn't as good as RA2 Tanya.  Kari Wuhrer did a much better job, and the actual Tanya UNIT is not as fun to play with either.  Tanya's range has been reduced to a point where enemy infantry (yes, even conscripts) can now shoot Tanya before she can shoot them.  Tanya is no longer the sort of ""hero"" unit that, with a small amount of support and a good deal of micromanagement can wipe out whole platoons of enemy infantry and bases with style.  This was a huge negative, as Tanya has played a very central role to the Red Alert universe for several of the Red Alert games now.  Going back to the Kari Wuhrer point though.. Kari was much more ""tough"" whereas the new Tanya is basically a cheerleader dressed up as Tanya, and she really just doesn't fit the role as well.

*Tanya's guns just aren't as good (or cool) as they used to be.  Looks like she's got some Desert Eagles now or something instead of the classic old .45 colts, and her range has been reduced to a point where she is basically neutered as a unit.  Not cool.

To sum things up, you'll probably enjoy the game, but it just lacked some essential things Red Alert 2 had.

First it was nice to get a campaign that is stand alone 5 STARS, I give this game a 1 since the multi player is - (Minus) 4 stars.  I played the Beta test and thought they would make changes, Not only did they not make changes, They changed all of the buttons! Now to Respawn you press ""X"""" Not ""A"", and to change to your anti titan weapon is no longer the ""D"" pad you press ""Y"", All the maps have dead ends and rooms with no doors so you are always getting stuck, You ALWAYS respawn Miles away from the action and where you died, Windows don't break and you can't shoot them out, or shoot thru them,  and the list goes on. Wait till your in a titan, they changed all that too, you'll die button mashing trying to just walk! I played 5 games and all the maps were the Beta Maps, That are HORRIBLE!!! This is not Titanfall this is Call of Duty with annoying big Robots, large open spaces so you can't wall run, kill ratio is wacked so your always dieing, snipers on every roof, like I said just like Call of Duty. All of the Titans pack together, since if your alone you die in less than 3 seconds. You last longer as a pilot than in a titan. (same from the Beta test) Your titan will last longer in auto mode than if your in it. (since the auto titan knows how to play better than you) This is nothing more than a Call of Duty Clone that has lost direction. No doubt this will become a $19.99 game in less than a month. I had such high hopes, only to be shattered by this.
Go back and play Titanfall 1, even though there is not a campaign, the maps, game play, and titans are more fun than this. Gone is the popcorn jumping, super wallrun speeds, being able to really take down a titan with rodeo, not some animation of you putting in a grenade in titanfall 2 (and if you rodeo them 5 (or more) times, where are all these grenades coming from??)  They took the cheap way out having you watch little movies of you doing an action, I want to control the action, not watch little animations the whole game.

Titan Defense, Burn cards, Smart Pistol, Data Knife, Hacking Specters,  Things that made Titanfall a unique, stand out, and stand alone game that no one could touch. Gone. Noting that made the game unique is there, Epic fail for the multi player.
For upgrading your titan, forget about it. They are what they are. You have to earn an upgrades, but they are worthless and meaningless. It's like they couldn't figure out what to do so they simply say your now 2.0, then 3.0 and it means nothing. You get nothing for upgrading or leveling up, so what is the point?

The story was lame and the action tedious and redundant. Also a few years before the game was actually released all the previews were totally different, there were images a cloaked baddies, and a totally interactive environment. This game feels like it started out as a huge sprawling sandbox action/adventure/horror/mystery then due to budget cuts ended up a lame shooter.

Graphics -
+ Nice, environments were very detailed
- Environments all looked the same.

Combat
Innovative system of breaking down enemy shields with a flash light then shooting them to kill them. Cool at first, gets old real fast.

Game-play -
This game consists of going from point a to point b and getting to a plot point then repeat. There are 3 types of enemies, and a couple of unimaginative bosses (a back-hoe for example). The environments while nicely detailed all look the same, with little to no thought in the level design, often you just head in a straight line through a generic forest, a generic building, or a generic office. The is combat fun at first, but once the novelty wears off (about 15-20 minutes) it get's boring. what makes matters worse is the cheap shots the enemies take. You'll find yourself just walking along or worse, fighting off a horde of baddies, when all of a sudden they start spawning right behind you, basically right on top of you. This happens so often and becomes so damn frustrating that you'll be tempted to quit, not due to the challenge but due to the fact that the game just isn't fun enough t keep you caring. I finished the game in a day, yeah it's that short, and that easy (minus the cheap shots.)

Re-Playability -
None, getting through this stinker once is a test of will-power

-The graphics-

Fuzzy character sprites, blood that is so cheap that it looks like red paint? Resident Evil took a whipping in the visual department. The zombies look like Re-Deads. And a brownish/black fuzzy blob is not scary, it's funny. There's been games like Tomb Raider and Croc that visually look better yet they are both PS1 games.

Like a Sweet Home spinoff, Resident Evil starts out with very little weapons, but with scarce ammo. The one major difference between these two however, are the controls.

That's right, i'm talking about button-busting control schemes. All the earlier RE games have an annoying tendency of allowing the character to die, a lot. When other games came out (and before) the controls were smoother, RE insisted that the characters turn painfully slow away from an approaching zombie, just giving the zombie enough ample-time to latch on to have lunch, breakfast, and dinner.

Now what's so scary about this game?

Is it given that M-ratings were considered 'rare' back on the PS1? The script? Or 'knowing' some zombie is gonna come out of that hallway sooner or later? The game starts with the player arriving on the grounds of the mansion (in a grainy video) then inside. Immediately there is conversation. The voice-acting is dull, un-lively and boring. Do I care that there's blood on the floor? No, why? because it looks like paint, that's why! Don't mind the plain-in-sight dead-body laying in the corner there, it's decor! Or not. Again, the voice-acting is as bland and convincing as a monologue broken-record. Ahh. Something's there. Ahhhhh. Bad acting produces bad results.

Given that it was the first RE game may be the reason for its praising, considering both it's puzzle-like feature of finding items/unlocking rooms and of course, the zombies in a squashed polygon-rendered environment. But by today's standards (Fallout 3 anyone?) this game simply doesn't cut it. Silent Hill has a remake of it's first game, it may be worth a try. But as for RE 1 original, it's a rent.

I have liked and used razer products for years and I never had any problems before, until I got this keyboard. Right away I would notice that on occasion, while playing games, keys would stop working and I would not be able to type anything.

It gets worse. When I unlock my computer after stepping away from it and letting it go into standby, I found that 2 out of the 3 times I came back into windows, things got weird. I would immediately hear the windows default ping sound that sometimes goes off and my computer would go haywire. Anytime I tried to open a web browser, dozens of the browser windows would come up. If I tried to close one, it may close but usually a few more windows would just open up. I did a few things to experiment to make sure it was the keyboard. I tried to do a google search and randomly it would put a space in between most of the letters of whatever I tried to type into search field. If I managed to get to somewhere on the web page, like a website that would have a online cart to put something I might buy in before checking out, it would put in multiple copies. If I changed the quantities, then without doing anything, the quantity would immediately start going up to multiple copies again. If I tried to open anything else, the windows pinging sound would just start going off repeatedly until I clicked on something else. I figured all that from all this weird stuff going on that it couldn't be the mouse because it wasn't moving on it's own and clicking on things like the quantity of the shopping cart so that wasn't making it go up and if I clicked on a different program after the one that started pinging all the time, it would stop and then start back up again one something else if I clicked on anything else. If I tried to restart my computer from the start menu, my start menu would start flickering like it was being closed and reopening dozens of times unless I clicked on something else so I couldn't get it to restart and would have to just hit the reset button on my case to just restart it. The problem with that is then 2 out of 3 times I restarted, both my mouse and keyboard would turn off somehow and just stop functioning completely. Sometimes it's one or the other but if I kept restarting another 3 or 4 more times, they would eventually both start working again when it gets it windows and I can login. After resetting the computer and getting back into windows with both periphials working again, then my computer would be fine until my system goes into standby and I wake it up again.

I figured it has to be the keyboard because of the few times the buttons stopped working after I first got it. Plus all those issues could have come from different keyboard shortcuts being used randomly for some reason. I am thinking it's a driver issue that got downloaded with the synapse 2.0 system but I can't figure out how to get the drivers to flash them and see if that fixes it. The problem there is that for this keyboard on razer's website, the only drivers that they have for the keyboard is the drivers for synapse. If they were listed on the website and we were given access to it, I might be able to fix it but it's possible I would still have the same problems. I don't know what to do and it's got me on my last nerve. I would send it back but I don't want to replace it with the same model and I don't think I can get any money back because it bought it here on amazon and not through razer. Most likely I will just buy another keyboard but not this same model and probably not from razer unless I just find one I like that doesn't have reviews mentioning similar problems.

So when I saw Zoo Tycoon 2 on the DS, I picked up a copy thinking I could have the same amount of fun, only portable. I was wrong. The game is nothing like the original. It's much simpler, and you can't really build impressive zoos. In the orginal game, you hire workers to care for the animals. You can still do that in the DS game, but I still found myself trying to care for the animals. And by care, I mean play annoying little minigames. You're options are severly limited in this version. You can't  build large, good looking areas for guests to sit and eat. There's only a couple buildings you can build, and even with research, there's not that much to build. And it's not even worth it to make buildings anyway. In the orginal Zoo tycoon, it was easy to make several buildings, and they would all generate a lot of profits. In this game, no one even bothers. THe upkeep is almost always more than the money earned. So it's a loss. My finalm complaint is the size. You're only allowed 30 animals, and there's very little space. I filled up over half my zoo with 5 exhibits.

This game seemed to have so much potential. The first Tycoon games were great. But, you can do a lot more in that game, even though it was made several years ago. Even the graphics in the sequel didn't come close to the original. This version was so downgraded, it lost what made the game fun.

Sim City 4 Deluxe is too buggy to play...

My X41's have one serious flaw - they pop every time a wireless device accesses WiFi and can interfere with access speed.  This new set fixes that one problem but fails to deliver the same quality sound and construction.

NOT PAIRED - INSTRUCTIONS ARE WRONG
Out of the box the headset was NOT PAIRED with the transmitter.  The instructions to do this procedure ARE WRONG.  I  thought my set was broken!  Follow the first part of the pairing steps but on the transmitter, only hold the pair button until it starts flashing, then release and wait.  It is horrible that the instructions provided are wrong.  I found the solution in a review on another site.

BUZZ - ANNOYING
There is no more pop or hiss like in the older models.  This headset has clean, pure sound - except for the buzz.  The buzz was predominately in the right side and was unaffected by cable or input combinations.  Like the other reviewer on Amazon noted - the frequency and volume varies which makes it hard to ignore.

SOUND QUALITY - POOR
If you have X41's you will be disappointed in the sound quality of Turtle Beach's newer headsets (see my other reviews).  I'm not sure if they are using lower quality components but the new models sound like you have your finger in your ears!  Even with the bass boost on, the bass doesn't come close to the X41's.
This headset also has a harsh compressor or limiter that keeps the volume at a constant level.  It might seem like a good thing but it starts to get weird when your gun is quieter than the sound of boots on the pavement around you.  Unlike the higher models, there is no way to defeat this.  This is not an issue with the X41's

BUILD QUALITY - CHEAP
You paid how much for these?  They feel like a product that costs $20.  There is a noticeable difference in build quality and feel versus the older X41's.

After I spent all night waiting for Uplay to download the game, which by the way would have only taken me an hour with Steam, the ga,e freezes with a black screen after you launch the game. The Farcry 4 title pop-up and then the game goes into window mode and stops from there. After and hour of frustration and trying everything in the book from restart to making sure my anti-virus and firewall are working properly I reinstalled the game again over night and nothing worked. From there I went to the forum of Farcry which is Ubisoft and saw that ton's of people are having the same issue from Downloaders to people who bought the install disc.

Then Ubisoft comes out with a day one patch. But that didn't work either. Later I stubble across something interesting on the forums. People started to unplug certain USB devices and that's when the started to play. Apparently  Ubisoft doesn't like you to have more than one keyboard plugged in at the same time, or gamepad, or wireless controllers. So if you have Multiple USB gaming devices plugged in and Farcry isn't starting, just start unplugging and eventually it should work.
I am not happy with this work around but I can at least try and enjoy this poorly released game. This will most likely be the last time I buy a Ubisoft game.

PC gamers are not console gamers and the software should be built for the ultimate PC gamer. I have a Keyboard, a Gaming Key-pad, and a Wireless controller.

This game requires an internet activation, so if you have no internet connection you can't play. Also you are limited to 3 activations - so effectively you are not buying and owning your game, you are merely renting the game.

This game secretly installs copy-protection software called SecuROM which can cause many problems for your computer, some of which are:

1. When installing the game the user is not informed that SecuROM is being installed.

2. SecuROM denies administrators full access to their PC, and blocks the administrator from editing certain parts of the registry.

3. SecuROM can interfere with the operation of hardware, specifically disc drives.

4. SecuROM can interfere with the proper operation of software.

5. When the game is uninstalled SecuROM is not uninstalled - it remains permanently on your computer.

6. The manner in which SecuROM runs on your computer is similar to that of malicious software called malware, and many people do indeed consider SecuROM to be malware.

Forget about a story line. You start as some guy (I assume Marty?) running down the street. You have to dodge hoola-hooping women, charging beefcake men, and bees (or maybe humming birds). Just like in the movie, you can grab a bowling ball and shoot these obstacles before they hit you! Occasionally you'll have a chance to grab a skateboard, but that just makes you crash quicker. Can you make it to the end of the block before 200 seconds runs out?

The only thing in the game that kinda ties it to the movie is a picture of Marty, his brother and his sister on the bottom of the screen, which fades away as time passes. Of course, I only know this because I've seen the movie, and it really looks more like a picture of George Washington, Jack White and Nosferatu with a bad toupe (now that'd be a great game!). You have to grab alarm clocks to keep it from fading, which makes perfect sense.

Let's say you make it through the five or so levels like this, which are all pretty much the same... It'll get you to Lou's Cafe (hey, something from the movie!), but that's when it gets even weirder. ""Bullies to go!"" it says as Marty walks in. He grabs someone from behind the counter and slides her down to the end of the room. Then it says ""Boy, they sure threw you out in a hurry!"" and you have to replay the last street level. Once you beat it, this happens again! And each time, you lose a life until it's game over! Is it even possible to make it past this part of the game?

""Wait... this game is mislabeled. This isn't Shadow the Hedgehog. It's that miserable Broken the Hedgehog! With the scent of a dirty diaper permeating from his speedy wake, this killer of classic gaming franchises does what he does best. He sucks.

1.0,False,"11 1, 2016",A3R40WIDGNO8C5,B01F9HMOBQ,Speerdo,"This isn't a very good game.  The graphics and the unique aspect of a WWI shooter will grow old after a few weeks of playing.  At that point and time you are left with the following.

1.  Next to no single-player campaign.  It's just a quick 4 hours or so of missions designed to get you familiar with stuff, but even then it doesn't do a good job.  For example.  There appears to be no way to use rudder/yaw control in the planes in the SP mission, but it's available in MP.  There's zero in the SP ""training"" missions that explains how things like medics or mortars work.  I don't know what ""K bullets"" are, yet my sniper class has 4 of them separate from my main ammo.  What?  If the SP was going to be a training curriculum for MP, the least they could have done is made it a bit more encompassing.  Score: D
2.  The game is wildly unbalanced. While this may be true of most online games(especially FPS games), it's extra ridiculous here.  All the review you read will say stuff like ""this game captures the hell that is war.""  Translation:  it's an annoying string of dying in ways you had zero control over.  Spawn into sniper fire.  Spawn into tank fire.  Spawn into a bombing run.  I have a K:D ratio above 1.0 only because I've been lucky enough to exploit some of these imbalances.  If I'm sniping or in a vehicle, it's a 2:1 K:D.  If I'm anything else, I'm going 0-7 to start the round. That's just the way it is.  Very unbalanced.
3.  The weapons are a joke.  Looking for a nice variety of assault-class guns?  Nope.  You get one assault MG w/ about 4 variations ranging from ""light weight"" to ""optical"" with the latter just putting a dirty retical on top of the gun and making it more difficult to see anything.  The other classes are all the same with only a small handful of weapons to choose from.  The cherry on top is that you can't even get into the menu to buy new guns unless you join a game.  This is probably one of the most telling examples of how 'thin' this game is.  Devs were clearly on a time crunch, and I'm sure I'll be expected to shell out again for a expansion pack that makes this game what it was suppose to be in the first place.
4.  There are very few maps, and the way they're set up are idiotic.  I think there are about 6 maps?  Maybe 5?  A few of them are downright horrible with a few of them being pretty decent.  They look great, but the lack of variety gets really old really fast.
5.  The new Operations mode is lame.  The rounds are incredibly short.  Nobody ever knows what the hell the rules are.  Do we get 3 tries to push into the next sector?  4 tries?  Nobody knows.  The sectors are tiny and the rounds are super short.  Just when you thought they couldn't have put any less thought into this, when the whole series of rounds are over...you just quit.  That's your only option.  You have to quit, then manually go find another game.  What is that?  Why not just start a new round?  It's baffling.
6.  Bugs.  Tons of bugs.  They're not major, but the sheer number will make you pull your hair out.  First off, you'd better hope Origin launches.  I have to go kill the exe every time just to get it to launch.  Next, you'd better hope the Origin servers aren't down, which was the case for both the BF1 and TF2 launches in the past few weeks.  Once in a game, you'll see bullets go right through players.  There's a blimp glitch that kills anyone who spawns into it instantly.  Planes can become all but unflyable at times for mysterious reasons.  Bombing sites decide to randomly flip all over the place for seemingly no reason.  And just when you finally get into the position you've been struggling to obtain all game, the server will crash or the round will be over because they're way too short.

This review focuses on the one item exclusive to the Survival Edition, the PipBoy Clock. The clock is a poor product, plain and simple, and not worth $10 extra, much less the $50 over the Collector's Edition price.

Performance is terrible. The clock doesn't work unless you use some redneck engineering on it with aluminum foil inserts placed between the positive battery point and the positive contact plate. Once you get the batteries in and actually get power to the display, setting the time can itself is cumbersome. The three buttons provided are often times unresponsive, requiring a good deal of wiggling at times to get the display to change as desired. The display, even with fresh batteries, is very dim, very hard to interpret unless the room it's in is very dark.

In terms of power consumption, it devours batteries, consuming three AA batteries every two weeks, sometimes sooner. In comparison, the old one-way pager I carry for my job, which has an alarm, storage for phone numbers and time received, and makes some rudimentary sounds if desired, uses one AAA battery every MONTH or so. This clock doesn't even have an alarm, and uses much more power for it.

Aesthetically, the clock is a mixed bag. The overall design and look match the Fallout universe exactly. My example, however, arrived unpainted, looking nothing like I expected it to look. I know the technology and ""look and feel"" of the game series is ""used retro science fiction"", but this clock is as drab as drab gets, with no logos or anything to maintain that sense of having something form the Fallout world, even if it's a fake. Further, the clock was at one point supposed to be wearable like the PipBoy used in the game. That too, has been nullified by poor craftsmanship.

Furthermore, the level of customer service provided for this clock from amazon.com and Bethesda SoftWorks, the game's license holder, is incredibly underwhelming. For one, in order to get any warranty work done on it, you must send in money, and the clock, to some company in California that no one's ever heard of. So for yet more money you lose possession of a broken clock that originally only cost you $50. Compare this sort of ""service"" to the defective&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gears-of-War-2-Amazon-com-Exclusive-Lancer/dp/B001CLYL24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gears of War 2 Amazon.com Exclusive Lancer</a>. When the NECA Lancer had its own battery issue, similar to the one described above, NECA and amazon.com worked to fix it somehow. NECA sent out replacement parts, for free, in a timely manner if you contacted them. amazon.com handed out $10 coupons good for the next purchase on ANYTHING they sell. Wither that level of customer service from amazon.com and Bethesda SoftWorks for this quasi-defective clock?

All in all, SAVE YOUR MONEY. The Collectors' Edition gives you so much more value, with the lunchbox and bobblehead being the best collectibles this year. With incredibly poor workmanship, lack of attention to detail, unknown warranty service from a company whose reliability can't be ascertained, and overall price point, this clock simply is not worth the extra $50 price.",Shoddy Clock Not Worth Extra Price,1228176000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

For those of you that don't know - the XBOX joystick has (among other buttons) 2 thumbsticks (one for each thumb).  Halo was the first FPS for the XBOX - so the Bungie programmers had to decide what these two joysticks controlled.  They chose so well that countless other programmers have copied them, and those that didn't - wish they had!  One thumbstick controls the motion of your character based upon the direction he is looking.  The other joystick controls which direction the character looks.  Did I mention that the Xbox jostick has triggers for both of your index fingers?  Within 10 minutes of playing Halo on the XBOX - I was pretty good.  Within 48 hours - I was one lethal trash-talking Marine!  I have two problems with the PC version.  First, let me prefix this by stating that I am running Halo on a P4 2.4-HyperThreaded/800MHz FSB/512MB/XP Pro/Nvidia GeForceFX 5600 Ultra 128MB.  Suffice it to say that I should be able to play EVERYTHING (expect for DOOM 3) at the highest detail level while having processing power to spare.  Guess what?  When playing Halo for the PC and there are more than 2 aliens on the screen - my system begins to crawl under the strain.  This is in the very beginning - imagine what will happen when I reach THE FLOOD (hundreds of aliens at a time)?  This is unacceptable.  But it is a shame that somebody messed-up Halo PC, because there will be gamers that will never know how awesome the game really is.  My second problem is actually more of a realization.  I now realize that Halo was so revolutionary because of the two-thumbstick/trigger controller.  It is extremely intuitive to control movement with one thumb while looking with the other thumb while firing your weapons with actual triggers.  The keyboard cannot begin to compete.  I read a review on a reputable gaming website that basically stated the exact opposite - he loved Halo on the keyboard.  To each his own - I guess.

I originally rated it a 3, but I am revising that score down now that I have seen how terribly one dimensional this game is in Hell and Inferno. What a massive disappointment this game turned out to be.

I really want to rate this game higher than a 3 (later lowered to 2), but some core features limit its appeal.

Unlike previous Diablo outtings, this not a single player game. It is a MMO/single-player hybrid. In order to play, you must maintain a constant connection to the battle.net servers. While this sounds fine in theory, it means if your internet connection is less than ideal, you face the possibility of being unable to use abilities because of lag or (much worse) being kicked from the game. Being kicked from Diablo 3 is especially frustrating for the reason below:

Unlike a ""real"" MMO, when you are kicked from Diablo 3 your quest progress is only partially saved and you are sent back to the start of the area. A spell of lag during a boss fight means you might very well be booted all the way back to town. While there are teleporters available to get you closer to your objective, people with unpredictable connections are likely to be very frustrated. As of this writing, 15 seconds of lag or so is usually enough to get booted. (This is ignoring the various issues that have plagued the Battle.net servers since the game's release, which obviously magnifies the problem.)

The actual multi-player is a mixed bag. There are some significant improvements from previous Diablo games and from WoW: all loot is individual (no rolling for gear or fighting over who gets to pick up an item, if you see it, it's yours). However, it is not possible to search for games to join directly. Being kicked from a game in progress means that unless you know the global names of the players you were teamed with, you are unable to rejoin that specific game. That means, again, if you are halfway through a quest and get booted, the next game you join probably means doing everything over again (although you do get to keep your items and experience).

Seemingly gone from the game entirely are stats, specs, skill trees or anything that would resemble character customization. Your character gets 6 spells or abilities, of which there are approximately 8 variations. Some of these variations change the power drastically, others change the power in a modest way. For example, one of the Wizard's Magic Missile variations simply improves the damage of Magic Missile. You are able to swap your powers around at almost any time. New variations of powers automatically unlocked as you level. Because of this, there is seemingly little reason to play through Diablo 3 more than once per class, because once powers are unlocked you can switch to them at any time. While this alleviates some of the frustration of Diablo 2's over-complex build system,it may limit replay value and sense of ownership for the player.

Previous Diablo games did not allow customization of the player-avatar, but that was more understandable due to the use of sprites instead of 3-d models. Diablo 3 is entirely 3-D, but you still must play using the pre-designed models. You are not even allowed to recolor hair/skin or add/remove beards, which at least would have established a bare minimum of ownership.

Graphics and sound are good, occcasionally exceptional. Fights are fluid and fun overall. Assuming there is no lag, the game responds fluidly to player inputs. Each act of the game is fairly long. Unlike previous Diablos, a significant number of ""drop in"" on you using creative animations (e.g. skeletons climbing up the sides of the maze).

Combat now includes the possibility of interacting with the environment in limited ways. For example, you can cut the cord on chandliers to drop them on enemy's heads, or knock supporting pilons out, causing walls to crumble on enemies. Although these moments in some ways have a tendency to feel ""scripted"" the animations involved are stunning.

Among the best improvements versus D1 and 2 are a significant reduction in ""inventory Tetris"" and potion management mini-games. It is also often far less required that the player return to town to restock on gear. Arrows are infinite. There are no ""mana potions"" as mana returns on its own fairly quickly or via abilities.

Should you buy Diablo 3? It depends on what $60 is worth to you. Overall I think there is a pretty good game in there trying to get out. Blizzard is known for post-release tweaks, so its possible several issues may get patched up. However, as of release date, the game could stand some improvement.","WoW Meets Diablo in a Single-Player/MMO Hybrid, with the Advantages and Disadvantages of Both",1337126400,36,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

Thankfully it didn't cost me much, because this game becomes pretty dull after a short time.  It's fun at first, but it quickly becomes repetitive, killing orc after orc and fighting the same bosses over and over.  If you don't defeat the boss, then it becomes even stronger the next time you fight him.  It's like a punishment for losing.  I spent far too much time fighting, then running away to try to find the ""health flowers"", then returning again to fight the same guy.  The bosses are almost always surrounded by at least half a dozen or more orcs, so it makes it extremely difficult.  I don't mind a good challenge if the game has more to offer, but this one just had more of the same.

Story 9/10
The greatness of the story is timeless.  Truly someone took put a lot of effort into writing this story.  There are a lot of great twist and the character development is wonderful.  You'll start to connect the with characters in no time.

Visuals 4/10
For the time these visuals were top notch. By today's standards these graphics are lacking.  This is to be expected.

Sound 4/10
The soundtrack is perfect.  I could listen to the menu them all day.  The music in this game blows me away every time I listen to it.  I didn't really notice anything wrong with the sound effects.  The voice acting in this game is really bad and often goofy.  Not to mention occasionally during cut scenes I couldn't make out what the characters were saying.  There are no subtitles available during some scenes.  Very disappointing.

Mechanics/Gameplay 2/10
Normal movement in the game is occasionally hinder by invisible catches which is slightly annoying.  The battle system is somewhat lacking and get old really fast.  You are required to do timed button pushes for your normal attacks.  It's fun for a few minutes but not 50 hours.  My biggest complaint is that you cannot skip certain battle scenes.  Every time you cast your dragoon magic you have to watch a short scene.  I'm pretty sure I could have cut my playtime down by a FEW HOURS if I didn't have to watch these things every time.  The final boss also has a lot of scenes.  Heaven forbid that you should die halfway through that fight.

I then played Saints row 2,thinking that if GTA IV played that good on my PC then this game should run even better since its graphics aren't nearly as good,i was dead wrong. This game not only looks way worse than GTA IV but also has HORRIBLE frame rate drops,pop up issues,glitches and some of the worst vehicle controls i have ever experienced in a game!

2.0,False,"12 18, 2010",A3G4BFD7FN8VF1,B003P9LE5I,Marvin Powell,"Okay. Usually I buy these games every year and play them, despite their flaws and such. SvR2006 was the greatest in the series and from there, the Smackdown vs RAW series has spiraled into awfulness like the flushing water of a toilet bowl. And speaking of s---, Smackdown vs RAW 2011 is probably one of the lamest games yet.

2007 had glitches and bugs in it, and a flawed new control style. 2008 improved the control style, but got rid of all the moveset moves, had a boring as heck story mode, and was ultimately boring. 2009 was the worst yet, with GM Mode GONE from the game entirely and no replay value, whatsover. And 2010 managed to breathe a little life back into the series with the okay Story Editor mode and improved gameplay and Create features.

So if 2006 was a (9/10), 2007 was a (5/10), 2008 was a (6.5/10), 2009 was a (4/10) and 2010 was a (8/10), what does that make 2011?

Well, let's see... the so-called ""revival"" of General Manager's Mode as ""WWE Universe Mode"" is anything but cool. It's like GM Mode or Story Designer, but with absolutely NO control over almost anything! You can't choose who will get to fight for championship title contenders, no matter what, and you can barely customize the matches. Even if you do, though, the game will ignore all attempted rivalry and storyline development, anyways. It only does what *it* wants. You can try to make a storyline, or use your own Created Characters (which the game never counts as being significant) and the Mode will just go, ""Yeah, that's cute. Now step aside and let the grown-ups do their job."" Any thing that isn't randomally generated by Universe Mode pretty much doesn't count. This might be forgivable if it wasn't the main part of the game! Universe Mode completely replaces Exhibition Mode. So, all the choices are more-or-less permanent, seeing as all decisions made in the previously ""consequence-free"" exhibition mode will now affect everything thing else. And you have virtually NO control over it! How fun is that? Why would they think it'd be cool letting a computer generate random rivalries and storylines that the player has almost no control over? Was this mode meant to work this way?

The gameplay is indeed different. They tried to add in a new physics/mechanics engine this year, but the game still plays similar to before. Only thing is, the wrestlers move so badly! I don't know exactly what they did, but the superstars and divas now move really slowly and wooden. The feel of the gameplay is far less organic and fluid than it used to be. While I give them credit for pulling off a good counters/reversals system, it just feels like you're playing with stiff robots, the entire time. Everyone moves so slow and un-organic. The pool of moves has been stripped down, once again. Just like in 2007 when they decided to switch over to the control stick format, all moves have been once again scrapped. I can understand why THQ does this every year, as they must not have enough disk space to keep everything. The problem is, the moves they *do* keep are always lame. They always get rid of the cool or not ""WWE approved"" moves and keep the same 16 different DDT's or Suplexes. This time, though, they didn't even keep those! I will give them credit for trying to expand the overall wrestler moveset and add in new options, like new Turnbuckle moves, but it's just too bad they had to get rid of a good 25% of their old grapples and strikes, most of which were some of the best and unique moves the game had to offer. I guess they figure Create A Finisher will replace those. Speaking of which, they added in a new Turnbuckle Create-a-Finisher option. But as it always is in it's first year, it could use a lot more improvement. We're just NOW getting to some decent options for the original Front-Grapple Created Finishers.

In other Create Modes... Once again, the Create a Superstar options have been scrapped. While 2010 had some okay clothing options for Male created superstars, females basically had nothing to wear besides a few skirts and tights. Well, don't expect any improvement, here. And as always, the hair options are terrible and are only designed for Caucasian men and NO ONE else. I truly, truly wish they'd just come up with a Create A Hairstyle option, cause it's really hard to make some decent created superstars/divas when the hair choices are so limiting.

In Smackdown vs RAW 2011, the roster is simply terrible. Probably one of the worse they've ever done. Of course, one with common sense would know you'd have to unlock some people, but even including that, the roster is still horrible. I can forgive them for all the missing people, if a lot of them weren't PURPOSELY left out, only to be charged for a price later on as Downloadable Content! And this WAS done intentionally, as the game actually includes them in it, but doesn't make them usuable until you go online and actually buy them via ""WWE Fan Axxess"" (which you can't do unless you buy the game new, AND have online access). Are you freaking kidding me, THQ?!? You left out Layla, Chris Masters, Nexus, the NXT set, and everything else just to CHARGE people for them? And you won't even BOTHER to make Alberto Del Rio, Daniel Bryan, Alex Riley, Jillian Hall, Kaitlyn, Naomi, more Legends, and countless others that OUGHT TO BE Downloadable Content superstars? We get you're losing support and customers THQ, and need to make money. But doing this only proves *why* you're losing all your support and customers for this game franchise.

The Road to Wrestlemania stories are just the dumbest. It seems ironic THQ would state they want their 'Smackdown vs RAW' games to be as realistic as possible (which is why they banned female on male violence in the games), and yet, they purposely limit their roster to be as small as they can get away with, and also give us a Road to Wrestlemania as dumb as these. Especially the Versus Undertaker one. It's so hypocritical on so many levels. In fact, EVERY Road to Wrestlemania in this game is pitiful. I can remember when SvR 2006 had storylines so good, they later actually became REAL WWE storylines! (like the ECW angle.) And now, we get cartoonish crap that even the real WWE would call stupid. At least SvR 2010 they had an actual Created Superstar sotryline in it. This game doesn't even have that. (And yes, I'm aware a created superstar CAN challenge The Undertaker, but it's not an original storyline made just for him.)

Overall, this game fails on almost every level to any of those that came before it. A few things, like Ladder Matches and Create A Finisher, have been improved, but as always, it's one step forward and two steps backwards. Of course, THQ can always get away with this, as they'll always have their little kids and handful of adults who'll buy and praise the game, no matter how cheap and lazy a job they did in making it. Kinda like the actual WWE, itself. At least the real WWE is losing fans and supporters for a reason, though. The real WWE ONLY wants to appeal to little kids and no one else, hoping to re-create the 80's or possibly spur the next ""Attitude Era"" in a few years or so. So at least they have their excuse for what they're doing. Smackdown vs RAW however, has no excuse for a game this lazily made.

I'd have to give this game a (4/10). It's SvR'09, all over again. For every good game we get that introduces Story Designer, we get a two bad ones that gets rid of GM Mode, and then introduces the far-inferior WWE Universe mode. Please, do not spend money on this, and let THQ know that if they want to still keep getting support, they're going to have to do a better job than THIS. Send them a message and tell them that lazily made games won't be tolerated, anymore. Some people will always continue to drink the THQ-aid, but maybe if enough people stopping buying these poorly-made titles, THQ will actually put in an effort to make a GOOD Smackdown vs RAW game. Because ""2006"" and ""2010"" are only two out of seven good SvR games, and that's when you clearly know they just don't care anymore, at this point.

2.0,False,"03 3, 2007",A3V952N1C635QD,B00069BV7G,Magnus BroadAxe,"You know, I am sick of all the hype about this game by a bunch of weenies that don't seem to know real combat, real weapons or realism of any sort beyond what they see on their TV screens.

This game is not the authentic real life war on-the-battlefield war game that all the geeks are hyping and signing the party line the company puts out.

I bought two of these games after reading the reviews and I have to say that you people don't know what you are talking about.

There is pseudo-realism and that is about it. Sure the maps are close, the look and sounds of the weapons are close and even the dialog is about right, but that is about as far as it goes.

These games fall down severely on the accuracy/authenticity in several key areas.

1. Ludicrous restriction on the tactical options available to the soldiers and the squad leaders. Some of this is bad level design, some of it is probably trying to make up for the limitations of their AI, and some of it is just plain dumb.

2. Ridiculous limitations on interaction with the environments. You cannot open doors or windows. You cannot climb fences. You cannot use the wire cutters that every paratroop carried. You cannot go under a normal barbed wire fence, which thousands of hunters do several times a day in america.

Barrels and crates don't blow up or even move when hit by a tank. You can't even climb over a low wall that some other men just went over.

Perhaps most unforgivable of all, you cannot go into a prone position or crawl. You know, the stuff they teach everyone in BASIC TRAINING!

3. The gunsights are ludicrous. The amount of creep even in a crouching position is ridiculous. If I was that shakey I'd head for the retirement home.

4. Terrible path blocking and object collision detection. Quite a few times when I had a perfect view of a target and as perfect a sight picture as you would ever want I could not hit the target no matter how many rounds I fired. In real life I would have put a round through both ears of my target.

5. Absurd size of the weapons relative to your field of vision when zoomed in. Come on folks this is ridiculously UN-authentic. There is a reason for the open sights on fast action weapons like the Thompson and other SMG weapons.

6. Really stupid scenario designs. There are several instances where you are put face to face with tanks and no tactical options except to run for enemy panzerfausts. Making this worse of course are the level designs that force you to follow a relatively linear and restricted path to said anti-tank weapons. This is completely ridiculous.

7. Poor level designs. Too many places you cannot go or step when you should be able to. Places you cannot jump over or crawl under where you should. Only in EIB do you get to even blow holes in the hedges with the TNT that all paratroops carried as part of their standard pack during that theater of operations, and then only in key places and one whole scenario.

8. Situational awareness mode. Give me a break. This is supposed to substitute for the advance study done by the troops? It's not even as good as a raw topo map dump. You are chained to camera angles around key points and there are no indications of any significant type for changes in elevation and quite often the terrain features are faded out due to the choices made for the camera angle.

9. Another limiting factor is that you cannot issue movement commands to a  location you know is there but are not lined up on directly yourself and you had better be on the side away from the enemy when you issue the order. This could have been easily fixed by using some option to issue commands while in situational mode, especially if that were better done.

10. Lastly the much hyped authentic tactics. Authentic, sure, in a very introductory and watered down way, severely limited in permutations, applications and variations due to all the other limitations of the game.

By the way, I am both a veteran and an experienced programmer and I am highly disappointed with this game on both counts.

If this is the latest in realism then it shows what a sorry state the gaming industry really is in. Of course I still haven't seen AI in a commercial game yet that matched up to what I saw undergrad programmers doing in college during the 80s. We deserve better and it's not that hard to do. It's time we stopped allowing these companies to hype this stuff up like it is so great when it's all fluff like pretty pictures and sound.

Oh, one PS. The AI cheats. You can observe how the enemy becomes magically aware of things completely out of the blue, such as someone being behind them, not moving or firing, and behind cover. This is inexcusable.",Tired of all the hype and BS.,1172880000,3,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Every 10 games or so the game will do an entire reset, you loose all cards used, and is annoying to say the least.
They really need to fix their servers!
You get dropped more than you seem to play!
Boo Titanfall!
I'm sure everyone has seen the hype on this and the ""selected footage"" but there is a lot of work still needed. You can't compare this to black ops, since that is far better as far as player control, and game play.
So here are my pros and cons to this game
Pro
YOUR A ROBOT how cool!
good choice of weapons
you level up fast to unlock weapons, perks, and burn cards

Cons
Long load times for games and you need at least 4 people (revised now 2 on each team) on each team to play campaign games
If someone leaves the timer will reset to 90 seconds once there are enough people to play (I have waited up to 5 min for a game)
it is only online so there is no single player game
Only one person can play (no duel screen)
too many bot players in the game
The camo perk is worthless and can be easily seen and seem to die more with camo on than off
Too many players take snipe positions and make the game less fun
You cant put grenades on titans once you ""rodeo"" them
You can shoot another player with a full clip and you seem to die after 2 shots
You don't know you killed someone since there is a lag on the death and you shoot another 20 shots after they are dead you need to look at the score notice
The game resets often
You get bumped from 2 out of 6 games while playing, Says ""Reconnecting to server"" and you NEVER rejoin, this is the biggest pet peeve (My Ping is 42 and my friends is 16 we seem to get bumped a lot)

This game was very fun, and very inventive.
It is a game that everyone should play. When you do though, play it for at least a couple of hours to get used to it though.
The controls are goofy and frustrating at first, but once you get used to them, you wonder why you would want to do it any other way.

So, coolness and fun, I give this game 4 or 5 stars.

CONS:
This game just ends right in the middle of the plot. You have to buy the next 2 games to find out what is going on.
This game doesn't end on a sub-plot like the HALO franchise, or any other for that matter. With most games, you expect the ending is coming and at least something gets wrapped up. It's like playing HALO half way through and then just throwing the game away.
So, to play 1 actual game, you are going to have to spend darn near $200 for all 3. Again, this doesn't end really on a sub-plot either. You find out a piece of information, and then the credits role and tell you to buy the second one.

1.  It asks you the weight of your clothing (estimated).  We all assumed that it took the amount you weighed and subtracted the estimated clothing weight to provide you with your weight for the day.  However, I recently started occasionally weighing myself undressed.  Every time I do that (even though I do tell it my clothes weigh 0 lb) it tells me my weight is between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds less than the day before, when I wore clothing.  If the next day I weigh myself clothed and tell it my clothes are 2 lb, it tells me my weight is between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds higher than the day before, when I was undressed.  I really do not believe my weight is fluctuating by 1.5-2.5 pounds a day, so I don't entirely trust the Wii Fit weight calculations.

2.  During the body test, some days I'm good, and some days I'm not.  Just like most people, I suspect.  But some days I will be consistently off-balance across the testing, AND fakely higher in weight (see #1 above), and yet my Wii Fit age is 7-10 years lower than my real age.  By contrast some days I ace all the balance tests and have appeared to ""lose weight"" and my Wii Fit age goes up alarmingly.  I'm 45.  One day my Wii Fit age was 93!  The very next day it was down to 35.  So I don't trust the Wii Fit age calculations.

3.  This may be because our Wii Fit platform is calibrated wrongly, or because everyone in my family is unbalanced (ha ha), but we ALL seem to have our center of balance quite a bit further back than the cross hairs on the tests.  All three of us find ourselves leaning artificially forward in order to hit the cross hairs, instead of standing as we normally do.  When we stand normally, we're back near the bottom edge of the graph.  But the Wii Fit doesn't tell us this is a problem.  So, why have the cross hairs if it doesn't count?

4.  During running exercises, if you don't have a pocket, you're supposed to hold the Wii remote while you run in place.  We have tried it both ways.  Holding the remote makes it jiggle more, and it results in a faster time for the person holding it.  Anyone who puts the remote in a pocket comes in far, far behind on the running games.  So we're not sure which is more accurate.  The remote-in-pocket might not get as much movement as a person running really would have; on the other hand, the remote-in-hand probably gets shaken more than a person running really would.

So, we use it as a fun and general measurement of how we're doing but it's not part of a serious workout or monitoring regimen for us.",Dubious calculations,1236816000,7,,

It's not even a pass through, all this thing does is let you use your SNES controllers on Genesis titles. The ones that work that is, and those that do work have sound or worse, video issues and don't look great.

I say all it does is let you use your SNES controls, because that's all it does, the unit itself handles playing the game and passes the video signal out via it's own cable sticking out the side of the cartridge- as the SNES does not have the horsepower to emulate a Genesis/MD.
I'm gonna restate that because I know someone is going to say ""but SNES is more powerful than the Genesis!"" I mean the SNES cannot EMULATE Genesis games because that's what you'd need to do to get a Genesis game running on it- or entirely reprogram games because it requires specific hardware. So again the cart is doing the lifting while the SNES just powers the cart and lets you use the SNES controllers.

You stick the cart into your SNES then take an AV cable from the cartridge to the TV, see where this is weird and stupid? Now I'm sure you're thinking ""but maybe this is cheaper than a real Genesis"" well, not by much, you can get a real Genesis + controller & adapters for around 30-40 bucks- the thing is you get ALL of that and you know it'll work with any Genesis game. This device has some issues running some games- depending on the TV you're using apparently, look it up on youtube you'll find a guy saying it doesn't work with all of his TV options ranging from CRT to LCD.

If you want to play Genesis games, either get the real deal, or get a decent clone because this is a gimmick clone that you stick into your SNES for no reason. It has issues with different displays, doesn't have stereo out (yes the Genesis does have Stereo, it's not hard to do it either). Don't think this is a bash against the SNES, far from it.

The fit and shape of the Xbox One chat pad is not as well integrated to the controller so where your pinky fingers end up has sharp edges from the chat pad and produces an uncomfortable feeling . See the image comparing the 360 (right) and One(left) chatpads and how they sit in their respective base controllers.
Disappointing. The keyboard doesn't feels as well seated at all.

I've been able to use some fine grit sand paper to smooth out the sharp edges of the plastic parts that make up the XboxOne std controller and the chat pad, so now with the chatpad seated it doesn't feel like sharp edges, but its still not as fully integrated like the Xbox360 solution was.

The headphone jack position on the chatpad is just a bad idea for couch gaming - if you lean-back game, the place you wrest the controller is on your stomach/tummy, and with the 3.5mm jack going straight out the back, if your headset doesn't have a right angle plug, your putting a lot of strain on that cable/plug.  So I recommend getting a 90 degree right angle converter to use with a headset that has a straight plug (like most do).

The headsets themselves appear the be identical in design other than the console name screened on the band but they is a big difference as well as a design flaw in the XboxOne headset. Notice the One headset went from the 2.5mm 3 conductor cell phone plug that was used on the Xbox360 to the more standard 3.5mm 4 conductor plug we are used to from modern smartphones. That's good but of course means you cannot use your 360 headset as a spare. It also means, I assume, that you can plug other headsets into there instead. Unfortunately as there is no apparent audio test function in the XboxOneX that I can find I cannot say whether that is good or not. The mic and headset and chat pad audio pass through quality are not readily testable in a controlled environment by oneself.

The critical flaw on the headset that comes with the.chatpad is that the plug, unlike on the 360 version, is not a right-angle plug but a straight plug. So if you game leaning back on the couch, likely resting the controller on your belly, the that cable to plug interface will fail from the strain put on it. Silly design flaw that should gave been avoided. The movement on the connector also causes crackling as the contacts run.

So for the poor design of the headset and the poor physical mating to the XboxOneX controller (compared to the smooth and solid for of the 360 variation ) causes me to give this a poor rating. If the Xbox smartphone app ever gets proper keypad/chat support the I'd say use that instead but that doesn't work either.",Lower quality design than the 360 version - dissapontment,1513987200,7,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fB1lflW5L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Qkhpti5wL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gDr4FlDyL._SY88.jpg']"

With Call of Duty: WaW, the developer, Treyarch has cemented their role as the proverbial second-stringer. They're the ""B"" squad that gets called in to play when the pro's need a break. The pro's of course being the creators of the Call of Duty franchise, Infinity Ward.

The graphics, game engine, perks and game setting have all been lifted from Infinity Ward. What you're left with is essentially a World War 2 version of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Sniper level? Check! Tank Battle? Check! Thompson sub machine gun, BAR, MP40...? Check, check & check! It's all been done before by previous games and if you're a gamer you've already played this game.

Perhaps the most unfortunate part of World at War is that in the obsessive drive to copy CoD 4, obvious shortcuts were made in the development process. Take the difficulty level for example. On it's hardest setting, ""Veteran"", one would expect to fight against a capable enemy. One that uses cover and flanking maneuvers to try to outwit and overrun the player. No such thing. Instead Treyarch simply relies on sheer overwhelming numbers of Nazi's and most frustrating of all, grenades. Welcome to the game where an enemy solider can simultaneously snipe you behind cover and lob a 5 grenades that hit your player on the helmet.

The online portion of the game took a hit too. Frequent disconnects from the host will ruin round after round. Spawn points that place enemies directly behind your character leading to some very frustrating deaths. Unimaginative level design is present too.

No doubt Treyarch does have some talented staff. It's a shame that they dedicate their days chasing Infinity Ward and coping their work. I say if you can find this game in the bargain bin give it a shot. Otherwise wait until the inevitable next installment of Call of Duty made by Infinity Ward.

--- EDIT ---

I've had more time to play CoD: World at War and I feel compelled to edit my original post. While I believe that the basic premise of my original review holds, no doubt more credit should be given to World at War and Treyarch.

I've spent much more time playing the game online and I have to admit that Treyarch has done a remarkable job adding options. The online portion offers fantastic options such as online cooperative campaign, competitive campaign, and of course the traditional Call of Duty online game types.

Star Wars the Old Republic is a clone of WoW. And as it turns out, you can't clone a soul. Or at least Bioware can't.

The developers have absolutely no idea how to make an MMO. The cities are totally empty and lifeless, the worlds are narrow corridors on rails, to the extent there's any community experience in the game it involves people running endless circles around an orbiting space station in the cold, dreary depths of space. It's an apt metaphor for the entire game - space is a lonely place and so is this mediocre RPG masquerading as an MMO.

The game's development was bloated and inefficient, wasting $200 million to produce a clone that to my eyes is noticeably inferior to Rift, eg, produced for a quarter that cost. Apparently they spent the money on big name voice actors whose talents are, for the most part, wasted in writing that would be rejected as the plot for a dime store novel, with the one exception of the Imperial Agent storyline, which is surprisingly good - maybe they found a different team to script that story?

None of your choices really matter, your companions are more lifeless than any demon pet from WoW, except with more complaining, crafting is a process of phone-a-friend where you don't actually do most of the work of, you know, crafting - although you can wait over an hour for your lame companions to fail, and the end game is terrible. They've only recently added the technologically ground-breaking feature known as a group finder - after merging 90% of their servers and firing one-third of the apparently not-very-productive developers.

It really destroys the suspension of disbelief that is necessary for a horror game. Again, the past games have provided an appropriate setting for a horror game (i.e a Japanese village or house) but Spirit Camera depends on your own place to create the atmosphere. Terrible. Are we supposed to go out of our way to find an abandoned building to play this game to get the proper atmostphere? Arent we paying $40 for the game to provide those things to the user? Again, because of this there is nothing to explore. You can even walk around. I think the player is supposed to be an immobile camera sitting on a tripod and not a human being with legs to walk around? Seems that way to me.

Tecmo's original idea was to do a 3ds enhanced remake of the original Fatal Frame, but Nintendo Japan's president rejected the idea and opted for this half-baked tech demo-y thing instead. Way to give a bad impression of one of gaming history's few worthwhile horror series to the faithful fans who (I think) this game was aimed for...

Other trivialities: the game can be finished in about 2 hours, and for some reason one of the bonus outfits is censored from the original Japanese version. Why have a T rating if the content doesnt exercise it? The game is really an E for everyone game.","An overpriced, Fatal Frame-themed augmented reality camera tech demo",1336521600,5,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YmSKstXIL._SY88.jpg']

The amateurish voice acting really grated on my nerves, as well as having a ""time limit"" to play the game, topped with a lack of true world exploration and character interactment.

Over a course of seven years, I heard the game was EXCELLENT from many gamers, so I thought I had really missed out on something special due to my quick judgment.  The original game, retailing at an astounding 100+ dollars made the title even more alluring.  Years later, I picked up Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria, thinking I would never play the original and this would be the next best thing. As fate would have it, VP was ported to the Playstation Portable!
Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this game.  Playing felt like a chore.
For those of you who sold your copy with the same mindset I had, or have always been curious about the title, but refuse to pay a ridiculous price for the original...you may want to rent this first before you buy.

Here are the Pros and Cons of this game:

Pros:
-A unique revision of Norse Mythology.  You can really use this game as a tool to cause Norse Myth buffs to ""spin on their eyebrows"" and the liberties taken with the Pantheon (Heh,heh)
-20+ recruitable characters
-Clean CGI visuals
-No random battles
-No need to worry about ""money farming"" to purchase arms and items

(*More of a personal ""pro"", for those of you who have played the PS2 prequel before this...Brahms. Oh, LAWD, Brahms! <3*)

Cons:
-PAINFULLY repetitive
-Lackluster sound track
-Bad voice acting (with the exception of the new CGI cut scenes), poorly delivered lines.
-Timed.
-Little to no world exploration
-Not much of a story, really.  Why were the Aesir and Vanir fighting one another? I was disappointed by the lack of appearance by Hel, Goddess of the Norse Underworld (..Hel).
-Virtually no character interaction.  Coupled with the lackluster story, this feels very hollow and boring if you're accustomed to playing traditional RPGs, and this missing element really formed my opinion about the game.  Lenneth is the only character that really shares her thoughts (which is usually the same ""ice princess"" kind of attitude).
I liked VP2: Silmeria in this respect, as a certain degree of camaraderie was felt between Alicia and the core Einherjar.  Many ""main"" characters were flat, had virtually no dialog or purpose, and back stories and motives went unexplained, even if one has played the PS2 prequel, VP2: Silmeria.  For example, how and when did Lezard come to become so sickly enamored with Lenneth? What was the depth of Brahms's and Silmeria's relationship? Lezard and Mystina?  During a certain event in the game, you'll be asking yourself, ""Why are Arngrim and Mystina even emotionally affected by this?""
-One DUD of an ending. (I received the ""A Ending"", i.e. the ""best"" ending)
-Voices CANNOT be muted
-Cutscenes involving einherjar recruitment can't be skipped, and can be quite lengthy.
-Items cannot be sufficiently organized. Searching your inventory for an Elixir can be a real annoyance if one has too many items
-Providing you meticulously preened your Seal Rating during certain chapters to receive the ""A Ending"", the 3 final bosses on Asgard Hill have an extreme advantage against you (As much as I'm ashamed to admit in this review, I wasn't able to defeat Bloodbane and reach the true final boss, and had to resort watching the ending via YouTube, despite cutting down every single boss and enemy I had encountered with relative ease--except the Mandragora in the Forest of the Elves. Oh, GOD, AVOID THE MANDRAGORA! RUN or use a Tome of Alchemy if you encounter them!)

All in all, rent this game before you buy.  The original PSone version certainly isn't worth a price tag the size of friggin' Jotnar (a little Norse Mythos geekery for you guys).  You might consider playing the prequel for the PS2, Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria instead.  That game too, has its rough spots, but can be enjoyable nonetheless.

For those of you who are Square-Enix fans, looking to play the good 'ol classics of  Enix and Tri-Ace, I recommend Star Ocean 2 (which is being ported to the PSP with major improvements).  It's a real blast!

The new mouse hangs up and the pointer does not move for a second or two at a time, then I can make it just a tiny bit, and then it starts working well again, for the next few minutes. I tired to go to support on the turtle beach site, but there is no way to contact customer support about the mouse - they do have support for the headphones only. I am trying to contact the seller (bought it from third party here on amazon) but I doubt they would have any other answer than to return the mouse.

Original review:

The mouse is quite big and hefty and has velvety feel, pleasant to touch. It is USB mouse, and it needs software download. The software is easy to use. The is a very thorough user guide on the manufacturer's page, too.

There is different things you can do with the software - assign buttons, adjust performance, adjust illumination, and edit macros. There is seven buttons, including scroll wheel. For each of them you can assign different commands like mouse buttons, keys (like ALT or CTRL) media commands like play or volume, macros, and even launch a program. There are five profiles, and you can make up each of the profiles for different programs you use. To switch between profiles, turn the mouse over and press the little button. They suggest to make different color wheel for each profile so you know which one is on. The performance settings will be saved onboard the mouse, so you can plug the mouse in another computer and still have the settings. You will need to instal the software and move macros to access them on the other computer, though.

Performance settings lets you choose between four different levels to customize speed, and you can even have different speed along X and Y axis - very handy, my mousing space is short and wide, so I increase Y speed and it makes my life much easier. YOu can assign a button to cycle through the levels. You can also adjust double click speed and lift-off height but those stay the same for all performance levels. Report rate can be adjusted too. You cannot adjust scrolling speed, though, which was quite a surprise. I did not notice it at first since the default speed is about the same I usually use. I hope they can update this in the future.

Illumination settings let you choose the color of the scroll wheel and make the wheel, logo and the front lights breathe or be steady on or off, or light up when you pressing the buttons rapidly (battle mode) It surely looks cool if you play in the dark.

There is a macros editor, that lets you record mouse commands, key strokes and delays between them. The macros editor does not record mouse movements, though.",Did not last long.,1430438400,,{'Style:': ' Grip 500 Gaming Mouse'},
2.0,False,"01 9, 2013",A3KQ14TBV7PAO3,B003S2MXSY,Michael A Brannon,"Let's get something clear up front: I'm an old school WWF fan, I have only fleeting knowledge and even less interest about the wrestlers from 1996 on. As such, I don't buy the Raw vs. Smackdown or WWe games because I simply have no interest in the current roster.

That being said, I've seen many, many pro wrestling video games in my day. A few were good (Legends of Wrestling 2, for instance) a few were passable, and most were terrible.

This one... it's not good, but not terrible. To wit:

* The game has a very simple method of grappling: this is both good and bad. It is good because it makes for a fast-paced game (like Wrestlefest), but its bad because it doesn't give much in the way of strategy. The grappling system is very unrealistic: one thing I loved about LOW2 is that you needed to be in the proper position to do a certain move. Here, like so many other lazy wrestling games, your character just does the move on autopilot.

* The roster is anemic. There are about 30 total superstars. Given the pantheon of wrestlers in the last three decades, there should be many more. A few wrestlers are added via DLC, but not many.

* The game can't even let you have a proper tag team match! You cannot tag out, you are all in the ring together. Seems like an extremely lazy design choice.

* No Royal Rumble, No Survivor Series, and a really dumb version of the Cage Match (which makes absolutely no difference)

* Furthermore, the game offers what appears to be a wide variety of matches, but there's really no difference in the end: everyone comes after you. Even if its a battle royal match, everyone targets you. This is especially annoying when you consider the clunky switch-target control. Often you're getting the crap beat out of you while your grapplers attention is elsewhere.

* This game has the absolute DUMBEST use of a signature move. Your character will not DO the move, but stands there, completely vulnerable, showboating for the crowd for about 4 seconds (at which time your opponent can [and often does] ruin the move with a single punch)... and even if you make it, your grappler will often grapple the WRONG DIRECTION and waste the move.

* Some games like Legends of Wrestling: Showdown were very, very obviously rushed and very little effort put into the game, with no vignettes, story or any kind of atmosphere. This game has three brief (but very nicely done) challenge vignettes -- the Undertaker's, in particular, was good. There is a nice little thread of comparing the old and the new, which leads to most of the unlockables.

Altogether, it's not the worst wrestling game, but it's not really anything special. If they would have spent a few more months adding content, polishing, and (especially) adding different match types that were actually different, this would be far better.

Essentially, it involves you pressing the x button over and over again until the battle is won (unless you want to cast a spell). You can upgrade weapons and armor, as well as skills, and the fairly complex skills element would be really cool if it weren't for the fact that their application in battle is hardly seen because of what's stated above.

3 Dimensions starts to stumble with the same problems the others had. While I like having to search the scene for evidence and put the pieces together myself, getting through an hour long stage to find I missed a single piece of evidence, or forgot a test and comparison check is frustrating. Having to find that last shred before you could question a suspect or perform a test was incredibly annoying, as you could spot what was coming well before the evidence accumulated to the point that the game decided it was time to advance.

Probably the worst condemnation is the fact that there has been no real improvement despite being the 3rd incarnation. The stages are still run as point and click, and are otherwise not interactive. Its a matter of patiently running your mouse cursor over row after row of pixels to spot the few items on an otherwise static screen, and the almsot snide remarks for your fellow agents when time after time the remark ""Nothing over there. Way to be thorough."" While the zoom in/zoom out camera effects and ""thought play"" you know and love from the show are great, I would've rather had an option to walk around in a basic 3d room, crouch and stand, have a sprite hand that actually open and shut doors and drawers. Aside from the filmed sequences, the only CGI motion is from the CSI agents and suspects, which is dull. The Pheonix Wright games from the Nintendo DS had just as much motion to them as this did.

While I'd recommend this to any fan of CSI, as its a acceptable injection for those of you who desperately need a fix, almost any other mystery game I've played to date can surpass it in almost every category with the exception of movie content and voice acting, which probably got most of the budget.

The single player campaign is way to short.  I played on hard an finished the game in about 6 hours.  This is on hard.  Had I played on normal it would have went even quicker.  The tier one mode is pretty cool but is also far to simple in many ways.  The controls and graphics are top notch but the content is just to little.

The multi-player is a real disappointment.  No, not because I do not like it or because it is not fun.  It is because of connection issues.  3 different times now I have not been able to connect do to server issues.  I go to the games forum at EA and the issue has been widespread each time.  Me and my son where playing together and I get removed from the game.  We had just started and had played roughly half a match.  He is still in the game and playing while I get the error message that the ""Master Server"" is down.  I have not been able to play a game since.  For 2 days now.

The first Spider-Man The Movie game was a lot of fun, but it had it's limitations- it was too linear, there was no room for exploration, and your activities were limited to the skies and rooftops and a few indoor areas.  Spidey-fans and gamers alike wanted more room to swing and more opportunities to use their great powers with great responsibility- but less linearity.

S-M2 bucks that trend.  In a nod to Grand Theft Auto 3-style gaming, the city is now yours to explore.  There are huge skyscrapers, dark alleyways, and bustling streets.  You can either choose to follow along with the linear plot, seek out mini-missions that net you points you can use to purchase upgrades, or hunt down hidden items (for no apparent reason than a higher overall score).

While great in concept, the implementation is sorely lacking.  There are only a handful of randomly-generated mini-mission types (car chases, robberies, air-land-and-sea rescues), which forces you to replay the same tired action sequences over and over and over.  Fun for a bit, but not for hours and hours of filler.  The way the game is structured, you have to purchase upgrades to progress- so you are forced to take hundreds of these mini-missions to follow the game's main plot.

Swinging around the city is lots of fun, and you get a bunch of different upgrades (web zip line and slingshot for example) that aren't really functionally necessary, but still add to your enjoyment.  In addition, you can pull off weird midair Tony Hawk-like stunts (also purchasable)for no apparent reason other than that they are marginally enjoyable as well.

The main plot is well done.  It diverges from the movie and adds in some nifty comic book characters such as Rhino and the Black Cat, but the generally outline- defeat Octavius and win back Mary Jane, remains the same.

The fighting system has apparent depth, but most combat against non-bosses can be resolved with button mashing.  It can be fun at times, tossing bad guys left and right- but after awhile pounding thugs into the pavement or hanging them off lampposts looses all semblance of a challenge.  S-M2 is also the 700,000 game to feature a Matrix ""bullettime"" mode.  Yawn.

So much could have been done with this game that I can't help but suspect that we were given an unfinished product set to be released concurrently with the movie.  It is truly a shame.

2.0,False,"11 14, 2014",A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B00LHTR65U,Adrian Jenkins,"I'm not sure why I'm bothering to review this. For fanboys of Gust, you could probably take a literal pile of crap, call it ""Ar "", and they would give it 5 stars.

But in all honesty, while I deplore the vast majority of slop that Gust hoists upon the JRPG market, I rather enjoyed Ar Tonelico: Qoga this generation (which, strangely, took a slight amount of criticism from fanboys - I guess in addition to irrational love, they are prone to fits of nostalgia bias as well). While it played like a budget RPG, hardly worth the initial asking price, I paid only twenty-five bucks or so for my copy, and it gave me a solid 60 hours or enjoyment (followed by a solid 40 hours of leaving my machine on to get the silly trophy for playing 100 hours). Ignoring the creepy pedophilia that has infiltrated this market, Qoga managed to tell a simple story in a simple way, with a simple battle system and a great ""dive"" mechanic. The word ""simple"" should not be taken as an insult, BTW - there is a charm in simplicity that has been lost on the Japanese game makers of this generation.

So I was actually excited to purchase this game, and finding a used copy for around thirty bucks (for a fringe title so close to its release, no less!), I eagerly snapped it up and, uhhh, dove right in <rimshot>. However, as you can see, I'm not nearly as enamoured of this title as its previous entry, for myriad reasons.

The first, and biggest, is aesthetic. What happened here? Ar Tonelico had pretty lazy character models, but their flat art was charming in its own way. The images were expressive and really drew me into the characters. It worked particularly well during the ""dive"" sequences (which I won't explain here - check a wiki if you want to know more). Ar Nosurge passes up the hand-drawn flat images for 3-D character models. The models are atrocious. The main character for the first part of the game (Delta) has no emotion other than a scary half-smile. It doesn't matter if he's getting beaten down, or sharing a tender moment - he always keeps this creepy smile on his face. The problem is similar for the other characters, although their one expression is more, well, expressive. But it completely ruins the cut scenes and the dive mechanic - I couldn't care less about the robots that are masquerading as the main characters.

The ugliness of the models also manifests itself in another way. Many of the girls wear underwear only across their nethers, and invariably, this underwear is pulled down in such a way that each of the girls have plumber's crack appearing. And it's every bit as sexy as the name suggests. Further, because many of the girls are waifishly thin, the rendering of their derriere is just disgusting. I could only imagine this appealing to literal pedophiles (and, honestly, because the thin girls look so boyish, pederasts at that).

Environments are pretty stock, and lack much detail. NPC models are just pathetic (and there are only a few!). I think that there are around 10 enemy models in the game. It just smacks of laziness. Also, the localization is a very bad joke.

The ladies of Ar Nosurge get naked early, and we are treated to multiple images of them in the tub within a couple of game hours. It might be appealing if they actually looked like women, but instead, they are drawn with no detail whatsoever. Forget whether or not it's meant to appeal to creeps - for someone who grew up on comics, this offends on the most basic level of all - it looks like crap. Long story short, the aesthetic here is embarrassing, and the game looks lazy on an artistic level.

The laziness pervades the storytelling as well. There's a lot of stuff to start about 7th-dimensional beings and downloads into systems, but it's a smokescreen. You might as well have been 137th dimensional beings, who are put onto the world by a god of the 215th dimension. It has nothing to do with the story whatsoever. The dimensional part was particularly noisome to me - I thought it might be a good idea to explain why this world, which is so similar to those of Ar Tonelico, exists apart from it. But no - you get some standard argle bargle about gods and whatnot.

The point is this: the story only pretends to be sophisticated. In actuality, it's a pretty simple tale, like that of Qoga, told in an unnecessarily complex way. Expect the same tropes that you have seen for the last 25 years in JRPGs. Churches that hide secrets, identity crises, a world-shattering event - you don't need the 7th dimension to explain this crap. It's only meant to sexy it up a bit, but it's the same slop Japan has been producing for eons.

The development of this story is glacial, and the glut of cutscenes further slows things. I mean, I got something like 8 cutscenes in a row, just from visiting stores over and over. Thankfully, the scenes aren't voiced, and the conversations serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever (even as character development, this is pretty bad). Just keep hitting the X button as fast as you can, and it will go soon enough. The story scenes are no better, but you probably want to read through the text so you can follow along. I usually read one of every three panels, which was sufficient.

This is Gust, and if there's one thing Gust loves, it's synthesizing items. Expect to synthesize triple digits, easily. Fourther, while you synthesize, the characters...dance. Why do they dance? JAPANESE HAPPY FUN TIME! It gets old immediately, and is further ruined by the fact that the characters keep those same stone-faced expressions throughout their dance. Thankfully, you can skip this. Not so thankfully, you are then treated to a long series of dialogue as the characters talk about the item they just created. This is utterly pointless, but you can't skip it all at once like the dance. I hit the button like crazy to advance text. I remember in Qoga that you could rename items - you might be able to here as well, but I never bothered.

Battle has been overhauled from Qoga, and not really for the better. I wasn't in love with the battle system from Qoga, but it was fine for what it was. Free-running, swinging swords by hitting buttons, protecting a central healer/spellcaster who couldn't attack directly - it was perfunctory mostly, but could be fun for difficult fights. In Nosurge, battle has become a turn-based affair. You have one character, and he's still protecting a spellcaster who can't physically attack or defend. Waves upon waves of enemies attack you. There's a bunch of nonsense about how attacking works, but it's actually very simple -some enemies have exclamation points or the word ""SKILL"" over their heads. Attack them if you can. If you ""break"" them (a mechanic that isn't worth explaining, except to say that a broken enemy loses attack abilities), or kill them outright, you are granted more attacks attacks, and thus more turns. As you defeat waves, more waves appear. Your goal is to get attacked as little as possible, so this ""break"" mechanism is key. Further, as you attack, your spellcaster builds power. If all goes according to plan, she can unleash a spell that will kill all remaining waves in one fell swoop.

Sounds confusing? It's not. Moreover, it's really, REALLY easy. In fact, on normal mode, you could literally just hit buttons, and never have trouble in battle. On harder modes, you'll have to defend, but strategy is still pretty much non-existent, except for the occasional boss fight. In fact, normal mode is SO easy that I recommend going to a higher difficulty from the outset, unless you just really want to get the game over with ASAP (trophy hunting, e.g.). To give an idea of just HOW easy this is, I only learned late in the game that the stuff I was synthesizing could actually be equipped to my characters. That is, I had initial equipment throughout much of the game, and had no trouble whatsoever.

And that leaves us with the dive mechanic. It's still strong, although I find the stories are much more stupid than touching. But again, it is marred by the horrible character designs. It's hard for me to believe, e.g., that Cass is really that upset with me, when she possesses a ridiculous smile throughout the proceedings.

Obviously, fans will buy this, but given the small number of reviews, I don't think even many of THEM are applying this time around. I would caution the general RPG fan. If you can find it for thirty bucks or less, it's probably worth your while, but caveat emptor regardless.",Definitely a step back from Qoga,1415923200,10,,

2.0,False,"03 21, 2006",A17KMHCEI7AI56,B0009K7ESM,L. J. L.,"Magna Carta is game I've been eagerly anticipating for some time now. It comes from ATLUS, who have a great track record when it comes to localizing niche RPGs for the dedicated player. It features fairly high production values with its detailed environments and 3D character models. The CGI is gorgeous. Unfortunately, this is one of the most sluggish, frustrating games I have ever played. I hear Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu declared Magna Carta: Tears of Blood to be one of the worst RPGs on the PS2. I wouldn't go quite that far, as for all the teeth nashing I did, I still was able to play it until the very end.

The story of Magna Carta focuses on Calintz, leader of the Tears of Blood, a mercenary group with the corniest name ever. The Tears are helping to fight a long running war with the Yason, a magically elf-like race. Things go wrong during a mission, and Calintz meets Reith, a mysterious girl who can't remember anything. They strike up a rather awkward romance- awkward in the sense that Reith is the goody-goody peace-loving type, and Calintz, while dedicated to peace in his own way, peace to him meaning destroying the Yason. Reith tries to discover her mysterious origins and Calintz searches for the Magna Carta, a legendary super-weapon that can flatten the Yason. Despite the fact that this description features a ton of story cliches, the story is actually pretty good, even though it unfurls at a snails pace. This story is not shy about presenting the unpleasant consequences of war and is refreshingly lacking the black and white morality of most fantasy stories.

While the world of Magna Carta is quite the visual treat, the same can't be said of the aural experience. The background music is adequate but unmemorable. The game opens with a terrible song called Tears of Blood. The lyrics on this thing are really embarassing and cheesey. Voice Acting is usually a nice touch, unless its done wrong. Here its done really really wrong. This stuff could curdle milk.

While story is a very important factor in these types of games, Magna Carta drives home the point that you also need a good battle system to carry you through 50+ hours of gameplay. This is were Magna Carta gets really sluggish. It uses a quasi-real time system were you can move freely about the battle screen. A meter fills up and when it reaches a certain point you can attack. There is no such thing as simply bashing a monster with your sword. You must correctly time a series of three button presses, then the character will glow, say some line like ""I have been trained to kill!"", and then launch into a complicated looking attack. Sure it looks cool, but after the first few hours you'll wish things would move faster. Did I mention you can only control one person at a time and the others stand there like fools?

This system is also effected by a myriad of other things like how much the characters like you at the moment, which is effected by things like what sort of gifts you give them and what the local fortune-teller said, the number of enemies and allies currently on the field, what kinds of chi is currently available, and how many times a friend or foe can block attacks. All attacks are based on one of eight types of chi. If your attack is based on a chi type that isn't available you can't do anything unless you happen to have a chi restoring talisman. The system is not difficult, but sluggish and cheap. A normal enemy encounter can last well over 30 minutes. That should not be!

Adding to the sluggish battle system is a sluggish system of exploration. You can explore in detect mode, where you roam at a snails pace but can surprise or avoid enemy in encounters, or run mode, where you move faster but will miss treasure chests and will be surprised by the enemy, effectively letting them pound you into Game Over. In Magna Carta, if you have to go somewhere it will be by foot. It takes a long time to get anywhere, because the world is expansive and you will be traveling the roads at the speed of a turtle. Couple this with the slow battle system, and it takes forever and a day to get anything done. More than once I wanted to rip my hair out.

Magna Carta is a game only for people with extreme patience. I imagine the vast majority of people who pick it up, will throw it down after a few hours.

Pros:
Fast loading times.
Smooth, clean graphics.
Solid, immersive BioWare storytelling (hawk goes through some really rough stuff)
Your 1st 3 years in Kirkwall
The new organized look of the questing system

Cons:
*Consolized travel system:
What happened to the real map, where you could see your progress to your destination and be possibly ambushed?

*Companion relationships: Now you have to track them down in their own houses all over town.
Too much running around. The dark camp with lit fire was such a better setting / environment. Granted, they aren't on the run in DA2, but you could have at least had them all in the mansion starting in act 2.

*Dialog: This one has been beaten to death about its comparison to ME. It's not the wheel so much, its the fact that reading is no longer neccessary: Just click top option all the time for safe convo... Is reading taking too much time to do now too?

*All the side/secondary quests were standard 'FedEx' fetch and reward style.
Quests: Are broken down into 2 categories:
1- You do it willingly
2- You do it unwillingly.
Why give the option to refuse?

*Combat: Combat in DA1 was awesome, it wasn't slow, it was realistic. It gave you time to think out your next round, etc.
BUT: You have Grey Wardens, super natural abilities, fighting at this pace.
DA2: Normal humans, backflipping, highjumping, twirling, tomahawking... looks great but...seems reversed.
(how consoler's handled combat towards the end, I have no idea.)

Dungeon Maps: Deja Vu doesnt even begin to explain the repetition you'll experience once you leave town. Srsly, I think there are 4 dungeon maps, recreated across 17 different side quests. You don't even search for the quest objective, you just run the through the dungeon the same way you did the LAST time you were on this map and BAM, you're bound to find what ever they were tryuing to hide.

*Story:  Kirkwall and 1 large outside area...That's it? a couple of random locations that go away right after the mission is done. What happened to travelling from city to city...lemme guess, DLC? Seeing the world map in DA:O was like 'whoa, thats a lot of ground to cover'...I kept waiting for the world map to be more than just kirkwall and WC...never happened. I would be lying if I said I was gripped by it nonetheless, but to focus the entire game on this one town? The sweeping, epic that was DA:O was lost in 2. AND SHORT - Dont even get me started on the ending. Lackluster, to be gracious.

*Crafting:  Crafting sucks in any game, but if you were up to the task, it was rewarding to put in all that legwork to find mats. Now you find it (a crafting resopurce) one time and it's in your imaginary resource store where you can pull out as many items as you want so long as you have the gold to cover.

Plain and Simple: You cant make DA:0 then follow it up with this...its just unacceptable.
DA:0 truly streamlined the PC RPG experience while delivering a movie-like story and managed to flesh out an entire world of lore that even interested me! ( I never read all that lore crap in other games).
Im not afraid of change, when it's a change for the better. But if it aint broke (DA:O) WHY THE !@#$ FIX IT?

This...unfortunately looks like a sign of things to come. If you cant trust BioWare to delivery nothing but an AAA game, who else is there? (Bethesda?...u must be crazy)
Im not mad at how DA2 turned out but I am very disappointed with BioWare. I think EA has finally corrupted the last of the good RPG storytellers in the industry.

*EDIT*:

Ok, nerdrage aside, after finishing it a few times:  This game plays alot like LOTR-2, the one where they focus on that horsetown (or whatever).

I would be lying if I said if on the whole it wasn't entertaining. But then again, this town had about as much detail to it as, say Redfall, or Orzammar from DA:0

No summary at the endgame. This was awesome to see at the end of DAO
No 'quest within quests' like when you go do a main mission and there are side mission items inside, or subquest plot twists within a dungeon.

It does happen to be twice the size of most Bluetooth headsets currently available, but since this is the first wireless headset for the Xbox 360, I'll give them a little bit of leeway. Also, the lightweight nature of its design somewhat negates this fact. The unit also has no problems connecting with a 360 controller either. The real fault actually comes from using the headset on Xbox Live. You won't really notice any difference hearing other people than if you are using the regular wired headset, but the microphone is just the way too sensitive. While hosting a number of games, I noticed every once in a while there was a player whose microphone would seem to pick up a constant string of background noises, if not, the player breathing himself. That players mic always seemed to be constantly sending feedback (or white noise), as if they were constantly rubbing up against the mike. I now learned that it was actually a byproduct of the Wireless Headset itself, not the fact that someone just had and ""over-sensitive"" mic. Now that I knew the problem was in fact the wireless headset itself, I found that the only thing you could do was to turn it OFF and then back ON again, which would alleviate the problem. Depending upon which game you're using at the time, this might happen to you at least once every two hours. Yet, on other games it might not happen at all.

It's nice and having a wireless headset, but if you like to play a lot of Xbox Live (20+ hours a week), you might just want to stay with the standard wired headset. It might have an extra lyre going from the headset tier controller, but if you're like most people you probably don't really find it in the way that much. Unfortunately, since Microsoft has proprietary technology on any wireless product, will have to wait until they decide to fix the problem themselves. Honestly, just find yourself a normal headset for around $10-15 and you'll never have any trouble, because even though the wireless headset has dropped in price recently, it's really not worth the frustration at even $40. besides, we'll probably see a ""streamlined"" wireless headset version for Microsoft not too long from now -- then we don't need to deal with that ""earloop"" thing.","It Functions Well, But it Still Needs Some Work",1165708800,32,,

ALTHOUGH SET ON A SHIP, THIS IS FAR FROM A PORT
And that is the good news. After a number of recent releases which were dumbed down to accommodate the (now 5-6 years old!)

I deducted one star for this annoying DRM scheme; however, if this is something that is not important to you, you can adjust my rating accordingly.

THOSE ANNOYING SAND FLEAS!
Following the by now common practice to curb zero-day piracy, this is yet another STEAM game that is (most probably) intentionally released full of bugs and shortfalls - to be patched out ...gradually. And at a slow pace.
This means that although you already paid for the game, it will be some weeks (if not months) before you will be able to play it properly! Of course this is far from a solution to piracy, it is rather a how-to-shoot-your-own-product-in-the-foot practice, BETHESDA.

Viking could have been one of the coolest games....Big, bloody battles, swingin' axes, big terrain, legions of armies, saving your buddies, did I mention BLOOD? (In which there's a-plenty!) And that's about the only good thing in this game......(NO, not the big terrain, or armies....I meant, the BLOOD!)

I'd like to give this game a great review!
I'd love to say this game has a great fighting platform.
I'd love to say that the user's manual is helpful
I'd like a lot of things.....

But, you ain't gettin' NONE'a THAT from this game!

Positive note:
GORE factor in the game...AWESOME!!

As for all the running.......and running.......and running, and more running, and trying to fight 4000 guys at a time.........well, that gets a bit....ugh! DON'T GET ME STARTED!!

My God, they should have named this game something else like ""Viking: The sometimes fighting, quickly dying, how the hell do I summon my army, and much running journey to Asgard"" because that's what this game is.

OK, you start off in your town, talking & mingling, then you have to venture out into other lands....BY RUNNING THE ENTIRE TIME....OVER VAST DISTANCES.....and TRY and free your Viking buddies, while fighting some bad guys along the way. OK, I can tolerate that.... BUT, once you get to a village that holds your buddies hostage, you get jumped by like 90 bad guys! Try fighting 90 guys at once.....yeah.....It doesn't work! (anyone remember Assassin's Creed?)

Yeah, there's other things in the game, but nothing worth mentioning.

Like, after you free all these guys, that are tied up to posts, YOU WOULD THINK they would join you, and fight by your side.....NOPE! They RUN HOME! .........UH, I NEED YOUR HELP HERE!

OK, I must be honest, there are CERTAIN times when your Viking pals actually DO help you.....Like, when you rescue your buddies that are in the ""cages"", THEY will help you fight, but, when you find guys tied to posts....uh, don't expect these guys to do ANYTHING except run home to momma! That's ALL THEY DO.....RUN HOME.....as quickly as possible. Now, I suppose if I were held captive, I'd run home to momma, too, but, this is a game, and they should be kicking some bad-guy butt right alongside you!

There's something about a Dragon that's supposed to help you, too....Not worth mentioning either....

ALSO, you're supposed to be able to use your Viking Pals for help & aid in a large battle....YEAH, RIGHT!...OK, Somebody show me how it's done! There's NO MENTION of this in the user manual, I guess you're supposed to just know how to do it....OH, I KNOW, I'm supposed to use ESP....My BRAINWAVES will SUMMON my army when I need help!......The User's Manual doesn't say HOW to summon your army, doesn't say what button to push, doesn't say WHEN you can do it.....NOTHING!

So, lemme get this straight:  Tons of running, more running, getting tag-teamed by 300 bad guys at once (just like Assassin's Creed), horrible controls, horrible Assassin's Creed fighting platform, lousy story.....SOUNDS GREAT! I GOTTA HAVE THIS GAME!

You gotta keep going to villages, trying to free your buddies, while getting jumped by 90 guys at a time, and trying to stay alive for more than 13 seconds.....and you have to do all this with the WORST FIGHTING SYSTEM in the world. And talk about SLOW! HOLY CRAP, my Grandma can swing a sword faster than this idiot! She can run faster, too!!!!!

So, I call this game, ""The Game of HOPE"".....WHY?

> HOPE I can figure out the controls
> HOPE I can find all the runes
> HOPE the owners manual was better
> HOPE my guy can swing a blade faster
> HOPE something cool will happen soon
> HOPE I can free these guys without getting gang-jumped
> HOPE I can figure out how to get my army to help me
> HOPE I can beat 90 guys at a time
> HOPE I can find a horse soon, so I don't run all the time
> HOPE I don't have to fight any more guys right now
> HOPE I can get my money back for the game!

Too few levels - Seems like you can reach level 20 pretty quickly, and being a RPG, the fact that your character just can't grow anymore is bothersome. As big as the game is, I think it's ridiculous you'd cap out on levels so quickly.
Maxed out stats - It's too easy to get stat boosters in the game. Eventually all your SPECIAL stats becomes 10s. If every road you take arrives at the same destination, then where is the choice and customization? The way the game is set up, it'd be better if your SPECIAL stats could go over 10, while your natural starting stats could not exceed 10. Skills too. Skills should be allowed to go over 100 like in the old Fallout games.
Speech - In the old Fallout games, having poor speech skills severely limited your dialogue options and had a significant impact on what your character can do. In Fallout 3, it just doesn't matter much. The additional choices you get from high speech skills are very minor at best.
Physical world anomalies - You'd see highway overpasses and buildings crumbled, and yet right next to them, a billboard would stilll be standing. You'd think the weakest structures would be the first to go.
Electrical power: Many buildings still have lights and electrical power. Nuff said.
Washington DC geography - The White House should be directly north of the Washington Monument, but in the game it is to the northeast. The Lincoln Memorial is very close to the river, but in the game it is much too far inland. Arlington National Cemetery is wall too far to the south in the game. Falls Church, Chevy Chase, Arlington, Fairfax, and Germantown are all in the wrong relative locations.
Vaults - The vaults are all really above ground cover by a small hill. A real vault would be really underground, like you either need to trek a long ways down or need to take an elevator.
Radiation - You can't get rid of radiation by filtering it.

1. Frame rate issues everywhere. The poor little Wii doesn't seem to be able to keep up with the game engine's insane level of detail, leading to really choppy scenes and movement. Thing is, the Wii SHOULD be able to handle this - I think it was just poorly ported.

2. Random weird sound effects. There are some rooms where you enter, and it sounds like you're under a herd of stampeding cattle for no reason. It's annoying and after a few minutes in the room, it just makes you want to return the game for a refund.

3. You don't feel particularly heroic. Going around levitating things for other wizards (who apparently can't master the most basic of spells, so they ask you to do it) feels contrived, pointless, and ultimately not why we play video games. There are several places in the game where I swear I'm not playing Harry Potter any more, but instead I'm playing Box Stacker(tm). (For those of you who don't read The Onion, go Google for it. You'll get what I'm saying then.)

4. People have mentioned the lurching pace of the videos; I describe it as if someone had rented the DVD version and accidentally sat on the fast-forward button. I mean, how hard would it have been to add some sort of crossfade between scenes? Come on.

5. The ""Occlumency"" portion of the game is just plain laughable. I literally laughed out loud at how ridiculously simple and boring it was.

To sum up, clearly this game was rushed to market. It's frustrating to play, the game itself is a series of boring chores, and the ""rewards"" are nothing but self-serving videos of the actors and EA staff telling you how great the game is.

I also want to know how it is that two completely separate game companies, Interplay and Activision, can produce two separate games  (Starfleet Command and Star Trek: Armada) that work almost the same and  reek of the same shoddy workmanship. It is products like these that make me  realize why I have abandoned Star Trek fandom in the first place. Because  like Deep Space Nine and Voyager, they are so lacking in the creativity  that made the franchise so worthwhile in the first place.
 Starfleet  Command-a space combat game by Interplay (Quicksilver), is so bereft  intuitive control that it becomes a laborious task to make any ship you  control do anything useful. Case in point, in my first mission with my  frigate sent after Orion pirates, it took me 15 minutes just to hammer down  the enemy ship's shields and constantly fiddling with my ship's weapons  systems just to get it to fire at the Orion. Of course while all this is  going on my frigate is endless rotating and turning all over the map. Why  should it be harder to NOT do something than it is to do something. At  least in Armada you can simply drag-and-select your ship(s) and click  elsewhere on the map to get them to go there. In Starfleet Command, it  takes so long to get your ship to do anything that I was given to wonder  why I had to select crew members for my new ship in the first place.
  And why, in the year 2000, with all the great computer games out there and  the high level of coding in those games, are we still playing so-called 3D  space combat games in 2 dimensions? I do not care if they is based on the  Starfleet Battles board game, I played that to and realized that it was  limitation with it as well. Why is it so hard to work in the 3rd dimension  and enable the player to go `Up' or `Down'? We live in a 3 dimensional  world and as Homeworld proved, it's easy to control, because the  programmers made an interface that was simple and intuitive as well as  functional. I am also given to wonder why people are not more critical  about products like this when they are so inferior when compared to similar  programs. If you comparison shop for a car, why wouldn't you do the same  for a piece of software. It isn't like Starfleet Command is the only one of  its kind. It is your money afterall.
 Just because it has `Star Trek'  tacked on to it does not automatically make it good: Remember Star Trek  Voyager?

I cannot fathom how many 5-star reviews this has received, especially when many of them comment on how the controls are difficult to master, can get stuck, and can be very frustrating. Not to mention that when the controls get stuck in ""turn left"" or ""turn right"" mode, it can be nauseating to watch.

Personally, I'm simply not interested in spending hours mastering the basics of a game that should be intuitive. Using the Wii controller to imitate swinging a sword should be completely natural. In this game it is just the opposite. Part of the problem is that they put both the camera ""look direction"" control and the sword control on the controller, and they don't play nicely together. It ends up that you have to use what I think of as the ""flailing hamster"" mode to swordfight, and that takes all the fun out of it.

The gunplay is mediocre. I've played much better on the PS2, and am spoiled by the GTA series to the point that I expect the aiming mechanism to be just as fluid and simple.

The graphics are surprisingly dated. Again, they're weak compared to the typical PS2 FPS. I don't really care about ""pretty"" graphics, but these are poor enough to deserve mention.

It could be that this game really needs a standard PS or XBox type controller, with lots of buttons and two joysticks. Too bad. It would be a fun game. I'm really looking forward to the Wii game where I can put down the shotguns, Uzis, and BFGs and just hack at a few bad guys with a sword.

2.0,False,"12 17, 2009",AMICVV9N2U2R4,B00008DHNU,Atli Hafsteinsson,"Sonic is not all about the speed. I wish the developers of Sonic Advance 2 had understood that. The Sonic games for the Megadrive/Genesis were all platformers that relied as much on exploration and tactic as speed. There were hidden treasures to be found to reward you for exploring the well-designed levels, as well as considerable challenges facing you on your way. SA2 feels more like a roller coaster ride; a fun one, but ultimately that's it.

The basic level in this game is thus. You start with a countdown to 'GO!', at which point you take off at lightning speed unless you try to stop. It's impossible to explore. Even if you try to take but a few steps to explore for hidden treasures, you usually wind up triggering a hidden springboard that propels you down the nearest slide, thus far out of reach of your previous area. How are you supposed to find anything in a game constructed like that? The levels are designed with speed in mind, not gameplay. I have turned the time limit off just so I could explore the very first level for a port to the Special Stage. And after almost an hour of searching, I'd finally had enough. That was just the first stage, too; imagine how hard the other ones must be to find!

This game is all about the speed. It's quite obvious. The faster you go, the bigger a bonus you get at the end of a level. All boss fights take place while Sonic is running, and I admit that that is where the speed is an innovative feature, building on the first Robotnik boss battle in Sonic & Knuckles. For every other Robotnik fight, you rescue one of your three companions; Cream the rabbit, Tails and Knuckles the echidna (whose character is completely negated by having him been duped by Robotnik again). The short cinema screens after each of these battles are a welcome touch.

In fact, where Sonic Advance 2 shines is in its style. There are a lot of interesting courses; my favourite is an ice world with a city in the background, set during the night. There is also a fascinating hi-tech zone and of course Robotnik's Death Egg, whose battle is the toughest before getting to the final boss. The music is quite good but not inspiring or memorable enough to compete with other Sonic soundtracks. The final boss battle consists of all of Robotnik's battles in one go, plus a very final master robot battle which, in a completely contradicting fashion, brings you to a full stop. It's ironic that the game's final boss should finally wipe the grease off your shoes, but therein lies the challenge; suddenly you must revive your precision instincts from the Sonic classics. You might say it's too little, too late, though.

These are the game's best points. Sadly, Sonic Advance 2 doesn't allow you appreciate it to the fullest, because it just hurls you on at too much speed for you to be able to. It's a game ultimately lacking in any depth to be really rewarding to play. Speed is not what made Sonic great, and his games can't sustain themselves solely on that - Sonic Advance 2 is proof enough. The previous title, Sonic Advance, has a far better idea on what made Sonic great.",A Terribly Designed Game,1261008000,2,,

I fell in love with MK: Deadly Alliance the first time I played it and have been a fan of the series ever since. When I was a youngin I used to try the old Mortal Kombats but hated them due to the cheap feel I got when playing it. Not the graphics or blood but the downright gameplay. I always felt like I was playing a computer because it would always take what I was about to do and turn it against me in a very unfair manner (I.E. I wasn't getting enjoyment out of a game that was supposed to be bought for enjoyment). I never could see the joy in playing Heads or Tails with a coin if I knew I would lose either way. This brings me to MKK...

I began this game with absolute joy. The graphics ARE amazing (for any gen system), the characters look wonderful, the environments, the moves, the beginning title screen. Everything looks spectacular. That is mostly where my 2/5 stars comes from.

Now to the bad. I don't find this game fun. I only play because I find some amount of intrigue in the story mode. It is well done as far as story goes but that is where it ends. The computer is not only set to do the same ridiculous teleport moves over and over so you can't get up or if you even tried to move it would teleport and knock you down again (Sektor, Quan Chi, Scorpion), but they actually had the nerve to make matches where you alone fight 2 fighters at once. These are frustrating as anything I have ever played in a video game. I had to block the people in a corner and hit the same attack buttons to keep juggling them into the air to defeat them. That's not fun. That's not skill. When they throw Quan Chi and Shang Tsung at you both with full health bars and expect you to beat them (Keep in mind Quan Chi will teleport on top of you over and over and over and Shang Tsung will steal your life over and over), I felt like ripping my controller out of the xbox and performing a fatality on anything that was alive around me.

On the same level of frustration is Shau Kahn. Your attacks don't make him wither in pain so you can hit him 3 times and it would just deflect allowing him to smack you in the head with his hammer, grab and throw you, then throw his hammer at you once you're up which stuns you only to spear you. If you get close he shoulder charges you and you cant even get out of the way of it.

Another thing that somewhat disappoints me (but not too much as I dealt with it in earlier MK games) is A) unlockables and B) the Krypt. While its nice to open the krypts and see what money can buy, where is the unlockable content? What happened to the days where you started with 10 characters and had to unlock/buy the other 15? The krypt is filled with useless content art, images of production, stick figure drawings, and secondary fatalities which you could have just looked them up online! No, Netherrealms. Content we can USE! More stages, more characters, more costumes!! SOMETHING! Out of the 100-some krypts you can buy with money earned in game you only get like 15-20 costumes. Everything else is some art of rendering or something. CONTENT we can USE.

Mortal Kombat Armageddon had over 60 characters at the beginning, told a good story, had good graphics, and this was for the original xbox! Here we get 25 characters and hardly anything to unlock but just a good story line we can play through.

At the end I do enjoy the story line, the graphics, but I feel this game is lacking. I don't have Xbox live so I can't comment on the multiplayer but I've heard bad things as people just spam special moves so you can't even move so I dare not go there.

The game looks fantastic but the content is a bit lacking and the gameplay vs the computer is ungodly frustrating (ESPECIALLY MAKING THE PLAYER FIGHT 2 PEOPLE AT ONCE IN STORY MODE - WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!). If you have $20 (which is what I payed for this) I would suggest Injustice: Gods Among us if you're into good graphics, story, and 2D fighting and if you like 3D fighting (like I do from the earlier Mortal Kombat games) I suggest MK vs DC. Both games have less of that frustrating/cheap gameplay feel but alas they still lack on unlockables for characters and more for concept art. Injustice will keep you busier longer as there are many more minigames to play.",The gameplay is where this game fails... everything else shines.,1424131200,,,

My first impression was, ""Where's the bass?""  I entered the settings and tried all the different EQ presets.  I also manually boosted the bass in the EQ and still practically nothing.  I did a listen test switching between my old headphones and the new headset on different settings and much preferred the ATH-M30 in both games and music.  With everyone talking about the 50mm drivers in the Corsair set, I expected it to be better than the 40mm drivers in my old phones, but it's no contest.

The other problem is, even with the 7.1 functionality turned off in the software, all my music still sounds like it's being performed in a cave.  Yeah, the cups for the ears are nice and spacious, which I love, but not cave spacious.  I get the same feeling in games.  I'm playing Dragon Age: Inquisition, and when I'm actually in a cave it sounds great!  Otherwise, it's way too echo-y all the time.

I deduct the 3 stars based on the sound alone.  Installation was fine, connection was easy, and comfort is ok.

Update: See comments for details, but I was able to get some bass out of this, raising to 3 stars instead of just 2.

Update 2: I finally had a chance to try the mic.  It was so bad my friends made me turn it off.  Now my fancy pants wireless gaming ""headset"" is merely wireless headphones.  I tried many settings with the equalizer, and equalizer APO and could never get it good enough for them to allow me to use the mic.  I had to change the mic input to my webcam mic and they said it was much better.  Less like a robot with a cold and more like myself.

I would definitely not buy these again as a headset.",Expected MUCH better sound,1418169600,3,{'Style:': ' H2100 Wireless 7.1 Gaming Headset'},

Pros
--Graphics - What can I say other than they look really good.  I love the 3D models and the voice acting brings back so many memories.  ""Morning Your Lordship"" never gets old.

--Castles - The placement of buildings is much more intuitive as you can rotate a building 360 degrees and place it however you want.  However those annoying peasants still get in the way sometimes.  If they're standing/walking where you want to place a building, you can't do it.  I hoped this annoying ""feature"" would have been resolved.

That's about all the positives I can see right now other than it's an updated version of the old game I used to love.

Cons
Man there are plenty to go around here.  That's why I'm only giving this 2 stars and I thought about 1 star but I enjoy this series so much and in fairness I haven't spent a tremendous amount of time playing the game yet.

--Pathing - Some of my army got stuck on nothing.  I issued an order to move to a certain area and they couldn't get there.  I tried issuing orders for them to move away from a building, they would acknowledge the move order, turn in the direction of the move then just sit there.  ARRGGGHHH

--Combat - Numerous times an enemy would be fighting my guys and they wouldn't do anything.  When I selected a squad, then right clicked on an enemy to have them attack, they would acknowledge the order but would sit there as their fellow soldiers got killed and wouldn't attack.  The only way to get them to attack was to issue a move order and then they would start moving, then realize there was an enemy and attack.  It was like they were sleeping or something.  Stupid peasants!

--Cut Scenes - Really?  Sketch drawings for cut scenes?  REALLY?  Oh man, they aren't even colored just pen an paper drawings with some blood splattered across them to give them more life.  Now I could easily forgive this as an artistic choice if the game play was more solid because let's be honest, if the gameplay rocks, who cares about the cut scenes right?

--Scoring Screen - After the first mission, the score screen popped up and there were only empty square boxes where it was counting up my score.  The score in the box actually read 0.  This was totally unfinished, unpolished and perhaps even untested.

Now I love the Stronghold series and I really hope Firefly Studios fixes things.  They've got a good start to a game.  I would even go so far as to say they have an excellent start to a game but you can't have something this unpolished released as a final game and gone are the days where consumers will accept this garbage as a finished product.  This isn't 2001, it's 2011.  It's time to update your business model Firefly as there are plenty of examples of companies that put quality first....not revenues.

But now, after ordering a copy of this childhood favorite and playing it for the first time in over twenty years I have to wonder if maybe those favoring the Super Nintendo version weren't on to something after all.

Between the clunky movement, control inputs that never register correctly, and an insanely harsh difficulty level even on the lowest setting, I honestly have no idea how my 12-year-old self could play this crap all day, lol.

The first time was for the PS3 which I think looks and sounds better however, the game itself has many issues. lets first start with  what is good. The city Fair Heaven is beautiful. it's very detail and lots of hidden ins and outs, you'll spend hours exploring especially trying to find all the cars. The sounds are fantastic. clank up the volume and drive through the many tunnels in the city and you will hear an orchestra of engines. They really worked hard to get every engine sounding like the real thing. The races themselves are engaging and challenging.

Now for the bad. The cops and their pursuit are best done when driving a low level car because when you get into the many hyper cars like the Bugatti or Zonda, the cops simply can't keep up. There's no pursuit soundtrack to amp up your heart rate. There's no pursuit breakers like in the original where you could drop a giant donut in the middle of the road. But worse, there's no penalty if you get busted other then losing speed point which can be earned back by driving dangerously. You will need to replay events to earn boost and other upgrades for EVERY single car including those in the Most Wanted list. Once you have about half the upgrades, the racing event become ridiculously easy. it's like the game gives up challenging you once you reach 50%. There's no longer a take down cam where you see your opponents crashing into a ball of fire and wreckage and damage to your car is minimal compared Burnout and even Driver San Francisco.

In the end, I just felt like I was doing a checklist. Find the Camero, do the event for the boost and off road tires, get the re enforce chassis, battle the cops and repeat.

Online it's chaotic. There are screens all over the TV and while there are challenges, you won't notice them because every time you get taken down, are new screen of meaningless stats of the guy who took you out fills your entire screen. if you are going online then it best when you have friends you know and just free roam and explore.

I could go on but it hurts too much. I was really looking forward to this game but NFS Most Wanted is a safety game. Not to bold not too bad. It's in the middle and that why I don't like it. Criterion Games has always been innovators and it saddens me to see their name on this. Each event starts with an artistic and at this mental cut scene.

Yes, the game looks great, in every sense. Yes, it's got ""new"" features like walls, useful sidesteps, and Just Frame moves (moves that require precise timing instead of complicated commands), but then again, these were all in VF3 more than five years ago. There are new characters, and some completely revamped old ones, which is good to see, and there's the usual plethora of fun extra modes, like Tekken Force.
Unfortunately, a fighting game is all about combat, and this is where Tekken 4 falls short. The CPU is even stupider than it was in previous Tekken games (the game can be beaten using only Heihachi's b+2 backfist and 1,2 jabs). Against humans, the lack of character balance is very apparent: Jin and Steve dominate all others to the point of absurdity, and some characters on the low end like King and Kuma have no chance against any of the top 5, even with Kuma's 75% damage two-hit combo.
If you're not interested in playing Tekken 4 seriously and just want to have some fun, this game is great.

 Unreal 2 for the Xbox is a first person shooter (FPS) game. You play a space marine named John Dalton. You travel with your small crew of bounty hunters to different planets securing alien artifacts. The alien artifacts are believed to be parts of a super weapon. Everyone wants the weapon, including power hungry

 aliens. Unreal 2 is very similar to the famous game ""Halo"", but it lacks the intensity and polish of, Halo.

There's nothing more I can say because like all FPSs it's the same thing all over again just in a different time and different place.

Honestly, I'm not the kind of gamer that likes to beat games quickly (I like to play a little of one game, and a little of another and so on and so forth simply because I like making my games last) but yet somehow I finished it in one day. The amount of time I spent on it was the exact same as any other game I have played (Bioshock, Call of Duty, Borderlands) but instead of doing around 25% of the game- it was finished. I was so disappointed when I realized I had finished it, because honestly I really liked the game. Another example of a game that was also sadly too short was Halo 3. I'm sure many of you have played Halo 3 and I'm also pretty sure that you also thought the game was too short. If that is true then I don't suggest buying this game. If you want a game that you can explore, do things how you want to and get hours of game play out of it, I suggest something like: Skyrim, Fallout 3/New Vegas, Dishonored.. those are all amazing games that are far from short and have endless things to do. With that said, another great game like this is Red Dead Redemption.
So basically what I'm saying is that if you REALLY like FPSs and don't care how long it is as long as you can shoot people then sure get the game it was fun. If you don't mind getting a game that has some shooting but is longer and has more map space then get one of the games I suggested.

2.0,False,"02 6, 2012",A14QDQQ1CV59VB,B00002S7U0,Amazonian,"As with most sequels, The 11th Hour suffers from trying to outshine its predecessor by doing something completely different while failing to retain the essence that made the first one great. Instead of relying on the exploration of Stauf's mansion to tell the story as you witness past events, discover clues, and solve puzzles, the story of The 11th Hour is provided through FMV cut-scenes players unlock by completing puzzles and locating items. The gross majority of these scenes take place outside of the mansion to supply background information on the person you are trying to find and the mystery she was trying to unravel about Stauf. Unfortunately, it disrupts the feeling of being immersed within the story and serves as a constant reminder you are being helped by someone on the outside who could probably call for help at any time. These design changes for the game mechanics and storytelling transitions the series from a suspenseful tale of horror into a detective mystery.

The 3D rendered graphics are fantastic and make exploring the mansion feel like a whole new experience. It is thrilling to walk around where you've been before anticipating what has changed and how, what has stayed the same and why, and what new rooms will you discover. Thematically, searching the house at night using your flashlight is creepy and sets the mood. However, since you cannot control where you shine the light, it also eliminates the opportunity to appreciate how much detail and effort was put into creating each room. You have the option to play the game in black and white, but most of the puzzles remain in color and the juxtaposition is distracting.

Moving through the mansion feels awkward when compared to The 7th Guest. Whereas before you would glide from room to room or item to item creating the sense you were physically moving, in The 11th Hour most of your movements snap from one place to another similar to Myst. If there were a time limit on the game (as the title may suggest), then streamlining how the player moves throughout the house would make sense. However, the title is just a gimmick and the eleventh hour has no bearing on your progress through the story.

Unfortunately, the game suffers the most from the poorly done FMV sequences (the acting and production in Night Trap was better) and shallow plot. The relationship between Carl Denning and Robin Morales is forced and superficial, leaving no reason to believe he would actually go searching for her in the Stauf mansion--why not just call the police. And since the FMV scenes are narrowly focused on the details surrounding Robin's disappearance, you learn more about the people in town than about Stauf or his mansion.

I first tried this game one year ago and couldn't get past the frustration induced by the first few chapters. At that time I rated the game a mere 2/10. I thought I might be more open to this game now, and sure enough I was, but I still greatly disliked the experience. I'd give the game a 3.5/10 now.

WARNING: Minor spoilers ahead. (And ranting, much ranting.)

The only thing this game has going for it is that it successfully instills the desire to determine who the real killer is. This aspect alone is what kept me playing. Hats off to director David Cage. The plot in this game is phenomenal! ...

... Until the ending. The game creates a number of loose ends and false twists that keep driving you forward, but rather than tying everything together and letting you figure out who the killer is on your own, the game unceremoniously throws the answer at you. ""Oh by the way the killer is this guy. Carry on."" What a great way to end an otherwise amazing plot line... Not. Of course, the game can't end the disappointment there. Oh no! Instead Heavy Rain leaves several loose ends unaccounted for, almost as if they never existed at all.

The delivery of the plot is dreadful. The game created no emotional attachment to the story. I didn't care who had to die or suffer along the way for me to learn the truth. With such a blatant disconnect between the player and the game, I may as well have been the killer myself. The story fails to build an emotional connection with any of the characters. Part of this issue comes from the entirely unconvincing acting. Madison is the only character with even a semi-decent voice actor. Everyone else in this game was utterly worthless. Ethan's and Jayden's actors are among the worst I've ever heard.

The interactions of the first few chapters gave me the impression that I would achieve the same outcome regardless of which choices I made during the dialogues. I attempted to intimidate the whore, but then that didn't work and I was forced to select the compassionate option. I attempted to ignore bits of evidence at the crime scene but was forced to complete the investigation. No player decision making there either. What gives? That doesn't seem to hold up to the promise of ""How this story unfolds is entirely up to [me]."" I suppose I could have decided to fail the origami missions, but I don't think it's worth suffering through the game again to find out if this promise holds true.

The seemingly irrelevant decision points just barely scratch the surface of this game's problems. The main source of my angst is that the mechanics are outright awful. At one point I literally quit playing because the character would not move in the direction he needed to go. Holding R2 to move is probably the poorest control scheme implementation I've ever seen in a game. More annoyances are that you can't read any options when you are prompted to speak and QTE cues ether disappear off screen before you have a chance to use them or they fly around so wildly that you can't tell which button you need to press.

Heavy Rain's content is yet another item in my litany of disappointments. The game forces you to see a shower scene full of female nudity. There is also a sex scene in the game that makes absolutely no sense in the plot and doesn't come close to correlating with the character development. The fight with Mad Jack was particularly horrible. I just stopped bothering to play after a few minutes of watching the weak FBI agent slapping a big black man. I rather enjoyed watching Jayden get flattened under a tractor, it sure beat the pitiful excuse for a fight I had been watching. The final stand off against the origami killer is just as bad. One thing is for certain, while playing this game you will never find yourself saying that the suspension is palpable; it's certainly anything but.

Playing this game was an utterly frustrating chore. Although part of me would like to see how the story would change if I played differently, I don't care to play the game again to find out. I'd rather watch a low-budge drama movie than play through this game again. At least then I wouldn't have to perform menial controller movements while watching the story play out.

My opinion after my first play/quit: AVOID!
My opinion after finishing the game: avoid.

For reference, here is an article quoting Cage claiming Heavy Rain is not a video game. A few words of advice: focus more on making it play like a video game so people don't have to suffer while uncovering the ""interactive drama.""

2.0,False,"09 5, 2011",A27SC4VWIQVMCK,B003O6EAM6,Brad,"Madden 12 is so-so.  I see it like this:

The football.

The football is okay.  It isn't great, but it is good, and on par with recent releases of Madden.  There are things which are interesting, and things that will drive you nuts.  I got tired of the run-off that happened before each play, outside of the final two minutes of the half(s).

Player Modelling.

I don't know who decided it would be funny to make all the big men - O-line, D-line - look like overstuffed water balloons, but I didn't care for it.  It looks retarded.

The Franchise.

For many of us, this is the reason we buy Madden.  The Franchise is lackluster in this incarnation of Madden.  There are a few neat ideas, but they have been executed poorly.  There are expanded pre-season rosters, and cut days, but they are very arbitrary. You can make the cuts,  then go sign a F/A and you don't need to cut again.  Also the menu is not really to my taste, I like having it up instead of needing to call it up, but that is a personal preference.
I think it is a GREAT idea to have the overall player rating uncertain, but basic measurables that remain a mystery?  I guarantee, every team knows how fast each player on the team is, for example.  This needs some tweaking.  There are measureables that make sense to keep unsure - awareness, ZCV MCV, etc...  But speed, strength, jumping?  These are quantites teams know.
Scouting within the franchise is also broken.  4 weeks of scouting over a whole season?  And all you get is +big hit, +stiff arm?
That isn't a feature, that is BROKEN.  Why am I paying a scouting agency to tell me things I could find out by watching college football for 20 minutes some Saturday?  You pay scouts for in-depth research on players.

The game as a whole.

I have one of them new fancy black x-box with built in wi-fi and hundreds of gigs of storage.  So I install all games I play.  This game still likes to hang coming in and out of menus, and weird places that you would think aren't particularly intensive.  They will probly fix this with a patch eventually, but how do you drop the ball like this and ask for 60 bucks to have the honor of gold testing a game?

The overall.

If you haven't bought a Madden in several years, you might like this, it may be the jump forward you have been hoping for.  But be smart, rent this on first, because odds are REALLY good you might think this won't be worth the 15 dollars you will be able to get it for used in a few weeks.","Rent this one, to see if you like it first...",1315180800,13,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I'm a 34 year old male who usually enjoys sports simulations, rpg, adventure, and puzzle and family games.

It feels very much like the I Spy games or Hidden Mystery games on the PC. It contains very little story with very short interactions with the suspects.  You do virtually nothing to 'solve' the mystery other than find random items within a picture and solve some simple puzzles.  The items are completely random and don't even go along with the story or setting (ie: within the garden you find a bundle of junk the millionheir left there)

Then to top things off, you suddenly have to perform some silly task before you can get information from a suspect (like fix a clock or find some ingredients for a recipe).  I thought I was supposed to be a detective.

It had a few nice tools, like the usage of a flash light, x-ray pen, and straw (microphone) to blow things around the screen.

Professor Laytons Curious Village was a mystery / puzzle game that was much better than this.  It's puzzles revolved more around logic and reasoning rather than seek and find.  Millionheir feels more like a word search with pictures (I would choose this over a word search) that have little to nothing to do with the plot.

I skipped the rookie mode and chose detective mode (you are given a limited amount of time to find the clues within a picture).  I had at least half the time left for each picture except one.  I never felt rushed to hurry and solve the task at hand even without using the hint button.  Upon completion, you do get more difficult settings if you feel like replaying it again...but I don't have an interest in completing a game just to find different items within the pictures.

Other reviewers call this a 'thinking' game, but I find there are much better 'thinking' games out there (Professor Layton, Flash Focus, Brain Age, most adventure games, most rpg games, and most strategy games).

Based on the reviews, there is definitely a population that enjoys it, so be sure to read their reviews to see if you have similar interests as I seem to be in the minority and not the target audience for this game.

This isn't a typical fighting game - it tries to be like a third person beat-em-up gone horribly wrong and overly-complicated. The system itself demands a fluidity no average games could put out, in an effort to try and recreate the feel of the show's battles.

All efforts to block or dodge prove futile at best, as most enemy characters can quickly link moves and death-beams faster than in the show, as well as having the ability to block any kind of move at any time (regardless of what the programmers, tutorials, and manuals say).

The ungodly character roster (over 150 - about 100 are unlocked by default) means memorizing far too many attack timings for both yourself and your enemy, should you decide you want to try and dodge or defend against such attacks.

You now have two different kinds of energy bars - Ki energy and Burst energy. Without Burst energy, you can't perform some attacks or transformations, and without using Burst energy you can't enter MAX BURST mode to use Ultimate moves which could save your ass in a battle once you're basically beaten to the last sliver of health in the first 20 seconds. Ki energy, on the other hand, is almost virtually nerfed and without purpose in  this game.

The first requirement is to find some boxes that are closed on both sides so the Wiimote can sit flat up on the boxes. The second requirement is that you have a table, but I would say two tables because when you tap on one box, the other player's Wiimote is affected by your tapping. I'd say one table would be sufficient, as long as it's wide enough for a couple of players to spread out. The idea of tapping on a table seems to be fun, but tapping on a box is a lot less fun IMO, especially because you have to hear the tapping of a box for the hard taps. Tapping on a table sounds good and feels good.
OK, on to the actual gameplay. It seems to me that Taprunner is the main game, and would also be the most fun. I'd have to agree on this,  but there just isn't a lot to keep you entertained for a long time, especially when tapping on boxes, and telling your opponent that his tapping is affecting your movements on screen. My nephew and me played several times, and unlocked all 16 games for Taprunner. There wasn't much variation, but the graphics are mesmerizing.
After Taprunner, and unlocking all of the runs, we played Rhythm Tap. The songs were very good, with the song Let's Tap being excellent. Tapping on your boxes when given the cue is fun to play at least twice max. It became old real quick.
Next was Bubble Voyager. In the 2 Player mode, it seemed boring and complicated, but in the 1 player mode made more sense. Overall, not very fun, but seemed very interesting in the Sega trailer.

The problem this game has is that it's not fun, at all. It's a chore. I played it for roughly an hour and within the first minute, I decided that I was returning it. Naturally, I went on to get the platinum trophy. Regardless, the developers weren't given enough time/money by Activision, or the developers were lazy and drew their inspirations from said games above, but ENTIRELY MISSED THE POINT.

Considering that this is a review for the Vita version, I had played it on my PlayStation TV. That alone shouldn't impact my decision, it's more like perhaps it's not a console game and it truly is a handheld game. Considering that the controls are utterly basic, without any camera controls, the game is surely a 3DS port, or the other way around; either way the Vita version is not worth your consideration. I'd wait to see reviews, LEGITIMATE reviews (ahem, other Vita reviewers), of the Xbox 360 version, for at least that version has 4 player co-op and that might indicate it being an entirely different game and experience. If so, I might just get that one.

The main problem that this game suffers from is throwing everything at the player in the span of a few levels. The thing I noticed is that the enemies are hardly introduced, but for the first one; the ""dirty bubble"". The issue here, that was not at all present within the games mentioned above, is that all of the enemies can be dispatched similarly. Just mash the square button. There's no interesting enemies considering this issue. The way that the game tries to switch it up, is that there are different attack types. There is the typical ""Karate Chop"" as seen in the other Spongebob games, except that in this one you can mash away without ever fearing being hit. The second attack is a long-range attack. There is a third, useless one, the ""overhead stop"" or whatever, but the same effect can be achieved, and better, by just using the Karate Chop. The absolute only variety that this game has in regards to combat is the 6 characters (Spongebob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, and Plankton) and their superpowers, of which can only be active for so long. That said variety? It's only within that time-restrained superhero mode, and even then only the long range weapon. Otherwise, the characters are essentially identical other than their appearance in in-game lines (which quickly become nothing but a nuisance). The three world types might as well be identical as well, as with all of the aforementioned enemies. The bosses are a complete joke, too, and not the good kind.

I might understand the appeal for the younger audience, but they shouldn't have to be subjected to such mediocrity.  The Spongebob games of the PS2 era were intelligently designed, charming, funny, challenging, and above all, FUN. These seem to be missing here, for Spongebob and his buddies are just terribly annoying and childish, whereas the older Spongebob games were at the least entertaining in their random lines. This game just has them spouting something about a dream or something nonsensical over and over again when dispatching enemies.

Unless you're a newcomer to the Spongebob games (ie. haven't played any PS2 generation Spongebob games), then this is something you'll want to stay far, far away from. It's rife with bugs, as it is clearly an unfinished product, made with either too little time, or too little care from the developers. Unless you like mediocrity, then stay away.

I found a single character was difficult enough for me so when they added four it seemed a lot more difficult to follow along. Especially, when they'd start doing different moves. I'm not 100% sure, but I think I could pick which character to follow and even if I switched midway through a move it seemed to count it in most cases.

I think as my husband was clicking through the menus for me he seemed to find where I could have the song broken down which would have been helpful but I'm not really sure how he got to that screen.

For me, I was a bit disappointed with this game. I don't think I'll be playing it much in the future. If it comes down to it I'd have to say I like Dance Central better for the Kinect and Just Dance for the Wii.",I guess I wanted more.,1323043200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I figured the size and the Logitech name would guarantee a little longevity. I'm not especially rough on my toys, but my gaming area is rather cluttered with numerous projects, games, books, CDs, computer parts, etc. so wires, mice, game controllers have a tendancy to get tangled and like any lynch pin, move one and they all come crashing down.
While the headset works, it's a little wonky in its functioning. It sounds just fine, but the microphone shaft is too short and ends up sitting on my cheek a half-inch shy of my mouth and doesn't pick up spoken word all that well. worse, it's kinda flimsy, the plastic too soft. It has a bulky volume control with mute button about a foot down the cord from the headset while at the other end is a small box with the Playstation logo on it. I suspect its a pre-amp or a signal changer, but it seems kind of obtrusive and gets in the way.
Is it worth owning? Not at its current price- if it were ten bucks cheaper it would be worth it. It does what its supposed to do, but not very well. There must be a better substitute somewhere.

HOWEVER

the product itself is so bad, i instead decided to re write the review to better reflect this product.

THIS IS NOT A GAMING KEYBOARD.

despite the advertising, this is not a gaming keyboard.  there isn't even any media keys to mute sound let alone a windows disabling key which is rather standard for this type of product. and no, just because it has a few rubberized keys doesnt make it a gaming keyboard.  this is a plain jane keyboard, no bells or whistles.  but you can expect that for 20 bucks right?

sure.

in fact, the only positive about this keyboard is that it does have the rubberized keys.  unlike the previous reviewer, i did receive the proper keys, no duplicates.  but this positive is also a negative as i did not receive the tool needed to remove the keys so i instead had to use a letter opener to pop off the keys, no big deal but still kind of a bummer.  then, the rubberized keys sit higher than the other keys so the rubberized nature of the keys causes your finger to get caught on them and actually hinders your typing ability.

also, the backspace key is so small, im constantly hitting the ""\"" key instead, its soemthing i will have to merely adjust to, but its a nuisance.

also, the peg that attaches to the keyboard on the wrist rest included with the keyboard broke off just after putting it on!!  lol, im not even kidding!  i would post pictures but honestly this product wasn't worth the time to write this review let alone post up pics of all the things wrong with it!

idk, overall, i think this product is below average when compared to other gaming keyboards and below average compared to regular keyboards as most of the regular keyboards come with media keys!

With the mediocre reviews of the Mega Man Legacy Collection on PC, I decided that this PS2 collection must be the way to go. The first thing I noticed when starting up the first Mega Man was the harsh, bold colors. It made it difficult to even look at the screen without hurting my eyes. Second, I noticed input lag; the first boss I decided to fight was Iceman. Iceman's level involves a lot of slick surfaces so Mega Man slides around. The input delay made it extremely difficult to properly navigate through the platforming sections, and I just turned it off. I returned the game the following day, as well as the Mega Man X Collection (I didn't even bother opening it).

I subsequently bought the Wii Virtual Console version of Mega Man. This is presumably a more accurate preservation of Mega Man as the colors are true to its 8-bit roots (no harsh colors), and the input lag is gone.

If you have a Wii or Wii U and don't mind coughing up the dough (this PS2 collection is a great bargain), I highly recommend buying the Mega Man games on Virtual Console.

I have been playing the Final Fantasy series for years and have played just about every Final Fantasy game from FFI and even some off titles like Tactics and Crystal Chronicles. Now, when FFXI came out, I couldn't play it since I refuse to pay every month in addition to paying for the game itself. When FFXII came out, I had mixed feelings but it still had enough stuff in it to make me keep playing and even though it really lacks in story, it's not a complete waste. I still like a lot of it.

So here we are now with Final Fantasy XIII and I can honestly say, without a shadow of a doubt, this is NOT Final Fantasy! This is some random bare-bones RPG that someone made that is only a demo of a game. A shell of a game. That's how I feel about this. It's unfinished. This isn't the hard work of Square, the company Square who has always delivered 100 percent into the Final Fantasy series. This isn't the work of that great company who delivered the masterpieces like FFVI, FFVII, FFVIII, FFIX, and FFX. This isn't the company who put tons and tons of hard work into the towns and shops and talking to npc's. Final Fantasy doesn't make you buy items from a save point. Final Fantasy is about going to towns and going into shops and going up to the shopkeeper and buying the items. And this certainly isn't the company who really delivered with battling and gameplay. Fighting is no longer fun. There is no more fun battling enemies anymore.  In FFXII, I accepted the A.I. but enough A.I.! I want to control all my characters!! It's not that hard to ask for, to want to be able to control all my characters in battle. Especially in an offline RPG.

UPDATE: I have to add something here that I also just found out. I found this on another site:

""This also echoes similar comments Kitase made earlier this month, when he said that it's ""very hard to make games on PlayStation 3 in the same style as the games in [FFVII's] era had. Making graphics will take an enormous time."" He explained that's also part of the reason FFXIII is more linear than past Final Fantasy games.""

Okay, What you just read is completely unacceptable and just flat out laziness and stupidity! So because we have amazing graphics, the gameplay has to completely suffer!? I'm sorry but that's just total BS! Excuse my language but this is just completely irresponsible and unacceptable for a gaming company who has always delivered 100 percent in the main series, especially before FFXI released. Now, if I have to sacrifice gameplay for amazing graphics, then I don't want any part of it!! Just bring back the old graphics but I know for a FACT that if they can spend years on graphics alone, then they can deliver an epic FF in every other area! Come on! This is pitiful. Just downright sad and pathetic.

This is just shameful. For about twenty years, Final Fantasy has never let me down. But this game is just a demo, just a demo of another random RPG with the words Final Fantasy on the cover. If this was truly Final Fantasy, I wouldn't be rating it so low and having to write all these things. But it's true, this is no longer Final Fantasy. Everything I have loved about Final Fantasy is gone. Sure, there are chocobos but you can't even ride them until late in the game. The only thing this ""demo"" of a game has going for it is the graphics. That's it. Square are ripping all it's long time fans off and so many people are just buying into it. I will NOT give in to their less than capable work. If and when they return to their roots and give 100 percent of their time and effort into a true Final Fantasy, only then will I support them again.

I know that Final Fantasy XII was a big departure with the totally different battling system and removal of random encounters but for them to completely change everything that made Final Fantasy what it is, well, there's just no excuse. They just became lazy and are making money off of it. Even Final Fantasy X-2 had more effort and work put into it.

First, as a video game, Acme Arsenal is just a generic third-person shooter with a Looney Tunes look. You might as well be playing Tomb Raider. The game fails to capture the essence of Looney Tunes humor. Instead, you fight robots. Lots and lots of robots. Over and over again.

It should also be stated that the two-player split-screen mode was a really poor choice by the designers.

BEOWULF was supposed to transfer the epic story of the old Norse hero torn between brutality and nobility to our PCs. The original story takes place mostly in Denmark and Sweden; nevertheless, since it is the only surviving AngloSaxon heroic poetry, it is revered as England's National Poem.
To those of you not having to struggle with its old English in high-school and are not familiar with the story: the Viking hero comes in aid of king Hroogar and defeats three foes (Grendel, Grendel's mother and a giant (sea-serpent) Wyrm - that unfortunately delivers Beowulf's fatal wounds as well). Since the poem runs for 3,182 lines, you can bet that the story is a lot more complicated than this.
It was this epic that provided J.R.Tolkien with the seed ideas for his LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy (he had even published a paper on its influence on Western literature).

Towards the weight of such legacy UBISOFT demonstrated...total and blatant disrespect. To try and fail to follow the complicated story could be forgiven. To flagrantly display no intention of using the story for anything but an excuse is unforgivable.
The game is released in tandem with the Beowulf movie. Yes, that means that the game drafts the appearances of Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, and John Malkovich.

This is the game that could had been (amongst many other things) RUNE's spiritual successor - being a Third person action slasher with Viking swords and axes and special moves. Well, it is definitely NOT!
As an innovation, two fighting modes are introduced: unarmed (carnal) and armed (heroic). Although your preference will determine the ending, this is not really a choice since the game pretty much favors the one fighting mode over the other at various segments. Using each fighting mode earns you points to be used in either improving your character's or your squad's abilities (in rudimentary RPG-like fashion - which this game clearly is not).

Yes, for a game following a Hero's quests, you actually have a group of followers, the Thanes. Of all the stupid sidekicks and squads I have ever encountered (remember the DAIKATANA bunch..?), these Nordsmen were surely...dropped the hardest at childbirth. Their AI is truly dismal! An enemy may be hacking just besides them yet all they do is stand idle and stare. You are supposedly able to encourage them to fight harder - yet to no effect.

Again, a game that took 3 years to develop isn't a guarantee that it'll be good (Daikatana anyone?). Diablo 2 is just all hot air. Lets start with the bugs. First of, let's start with the technical goof ups. The  game had problems with some CD drives. It takes me 3 to 5 tries just to  have my Creative DVD recognize the CD. This is a major bug. Second, the CD  had problems ejecting from my drive, thanks to the patch they released  v. 1.02, it still didn't fix it. Thanks for nothing Blizzard. Third, the game  won't run on my GeforceDDR under Direct 3D. So now, Im running the game  using DirectDraw from my GeforceDDR. I ran the game using 3dfx glide and  the graphics were so washed out and hazy. What do you expect from glide?  Now let's go with the gameplay. It is absolutely similar with the first  Diablo. Sure they upgraded the graphics and all, but gameplay is still the  same old Diablo. The game comes in 3 CDs. The first CD will take you only  about 4 hours to finish it because the monsters are just too dumb and too  easy to beat. You'll have the case of BOREDOM by the time you finish CD1.  As you progress deeper into the game, you start to realize that the  challenge becomes more of simply just finishing it because you paid [good money]  for it rather than seeing the end of the game. Motivation factor is zero.  There were a lot of new items and weapons not found in the old Diablo but  new items and new weapons just isn't enough to save this game. Maps are 3  times bigger than the old Diablo. Other than that, this game is just a  waste of time because it runs and feels like the old Diablo which is  already a tired old engine to spend your gaming hours on. I enjoyed playing  Nox more than Diablo II. Newcomers in the Diablo world will feel just dandy  with this game. Old Diablo players will go ho-hum with this one.

I play video games to have fun.  This game was anything but fun.  You are so worried with staying alive throughout an entire level that there is no fun.  The easiest level of difficulty in this game was way too hard for me.  I was constantly dying or having to use artifacts to stay alive, it was ridiculous.  I stopped playing this game at the final boss battle of level 2, because I couldn't beat it.  Yes, level 2.  There are 14 levels.  I can't imagine the boss from level 14.

Other than the difficulty, I hated that I needed to search out power-ups, artifacts, ect.  I just want to go through a level and kill a bunch of people. Is that too much to ask?

If you thought you would like this game, or are considering buying it but don't want to fight for you're life through the 14+ hour campaign, buy NJ3.  Much better game.  No artifacts to search out, much easier difficulty, shorter campaign.

2.0,False,"12 6, 2006",A2615K4AJSX078,B000E0XX9Q,H.Le,"Overall, this is an excellent game that is still in the beta stage. Therefore, 1) please do not buy this game unless your gaming computer meets the recommended requirements -- not the minimum requirements - that is almost certainly not good enough.  2) even if you can run the game smoothly, be ready for bugs.  3) be sure to download all the patches: either 1.02 or 1.03 beta (they're huge)  4) Go to the NWN2 community web site and see what kind of problems are out there (there are tons of problems - some of which you surely will encounter) I won't go over them because there are simply too many to list and they happen too randomly.  That is, the few reviewers who criticized the ""whiners"" did not experience them.  On the other hand, there are a lot of non-whiners who have absolutely legitimate reasons to complain over a game that is being released at least 6 months too early. I hope to be fair to both group.

With that said, please let me repeat that this is still an excellent game that has major issues.  Graphic is good but NOT spectacular considering the game being a resource hog.  Oblivion, albeit being a different type of gameplay, truly has spectacular graphic for the same system requirement.  However, we all know that games should not be based on eye candies alone but on how fun it is to play, and that is NWN 2's saving grace. Gameplay is a big improvement over NWN1.  You now have almost full control of up to 5 party members - very similar to Star Wars Knight of the Republic 2 (from the same maker, Obsidian) with a touch of Baldur's Gate gameplay thrown in, but do not expect the same level of high precision of control over party members as in Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale. But that also means that you don't have to micro-manage too much, so it's a give and take situation.  It does take a while, maybe even a great while, or maybe never, but if you can get over the camera annoyances and come to term with it, the game play can really rock as this is really a fun game.

The story is excellent, though not as compelling as NWN 1.  Once you get into it, it will hook you and won't let go.  This is simply what Obsidian does best in this game (and probably all their games).  There is noticeable lack of a central character that you can immediately identify as both the antagonist and a protagonist, and develope a love/hate relationship with, such as Kreia in SWKOTOR 2 or Aribeth in NWN 1.  Regardless, it still is great story telling.

Sound is also excellent but also has lot of minor setback.  To begin with, there are very good theme and backgrougd sound and music, as well as good voice acting.  The complain here is that way too much are borrowed from NWN 1.  If you ever play SWKOTOR 2, you will probably agree that the Obsidian team has plenty of musical talents that does not require borrowed-music.  Perhaps the problem here, as well, is the fact that the game is being released way too early.

As is, my biggest complaint is directed at the corporate suits, AKA the new Arch-Angels of the new God: Profit, that pushes this game to release before X-mas, all for the sake of being able to make the timely offering to their newfound God. My next complaint goes to Obsidian, an extremely talented team (I've played all their games - I've been a gamer since the late 80's) that has the leverage to play hard ball, but instead, chose to bow down or (or bend over) to the Arch-Angels and take it with a smile.

Lastly, I should also complain about us, the gaming community that, apparently, are beginning to think that it is OK to produce unfinished games. Please take some times to think about this.  If you have a real job, you would agree that there is no chance in hell that you can release an incomplete product that did not make it through quality control -- and worst of all, think that it is OK to do so. If you want to be more precise, then here's one: a game should easily run with the stated minimum requirement printed on the box (recommended requirements are purely for eye candies). Do your own research and you will find that is not the case with NWN2.  With that said, I will make myself a reminder to look for Atari's contact email so I can ""whine"" at the right place.

In conclusion, this is an excellent game if you have the recommended gaming rig (remember: recommended - not minimum), and have the patient to deal with the bugs. Your best bet, however, is to wait a 2-3 more months for more patches to come out, and probably at cheaper price, to make it really worth it.

The first thing that grabs you is how dull the graphics look once the (well-done) cinematics end. On top of that, it is not that the environments are badly designed, it is that the same patterns are used over and over resulting in...chain deja-vue episodes. This cookie-cutter approach could had made it easier to get lost - unfortunately, there is not even a chance for that.

FOLLOW THE SCRIPT OR ELSE, CAPICE?
If you enjoyed the freedom experienced in the GTA series, well, do not expect anything close to that degree of sandbox roaming. This a linear game only set on an open-looking background. Which, once more, shows that looks were considered more important than substance. And if you make a mistake and have to reload, be prepared to replay quite a long sequence because this is yet another game with only an autosaving option - and, once more, 2K behaves as if autosaving points are charged by the unit.

JUST KEEP MAKING THE ROUNDS PAISANO!
The next disappointment is how repetitive the gameplay itself is. ""Great fighting mechanics"" means all of two options: hitting or backstepping. Whereas, ""realistic driving"" means that your cars handle like boats - and you will still get killed once those 1940's-Detroit death-traps hit a wall or a tree. Realistic? Sure. But fun? Veramente not! All the mini-games and the money-worries are simply too trivial and half-baked to save the day. Fight-by-numbers made it to the big leagues...

As if all of the above were not enough, the camera placement was so bad it reminded me of the notorious NEVERWINTER NIGHTS days. And sometimes, this turns more into a spectacle than a game.

I always had a problem with censorship boards (from totalitarian censorship bureaus to Nielsen ratings) but, at the same time, I do respect the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit. Well, MAFIA II will manage to enrage both sides of the generation gap. If the slow-news days keep up, expect some ""outraged"" news-reports on the content of this game before school begins. True, there are numerous instances in which this game justifies its MATURE (17+) rating - but this hardly makes it an adult game. Like a Dutch school painting of children looking like smaller adults, MAFIA II offers the juvenile version of a grownup world. I very much doubt that any teenager (which obviously is the target demographic for this game) will be impressed.

And for all this ...fun, we still have to activate the game and tie to permanently to a STEAM account. This is clearly not one of those game you would want to keep, so shouldn't you be able to resell it? Well, 2K GAMES thinks not. You can now make your decision accordingly.

No, I didn't finish it, but I've already had then ending spoiled for me by everybody who applauds it as the best game of the year, and some even say EVER. I did, however, play for about two months and couldn't do it anymore.

Frankly, I thought this game would be amazing. ""Oblivion with cowboys"" was what the guy who made me buy it hailed it as. If he meant a huge world like Elder Scrolls, yea, he was right on the money. It opens well, and it's fun for about a week. But like Oblivion, it takes months to finish. The biggest reason for that is that this game is 20% story, 80% side missions that don't matter. A lot of gamers don't have the patience for a game that lasts months, especially when it's as glitchy as the 360 version is (I don't know about the PS3 version).

The graphics were ""amazing"" but I've seen better, really. They were fairly accurate in their setting (cacti for the specific region were right, the animals looked pretty good, etc) however, graphics don't make a game.

i have played the PC version of Mass Effect far enough to get all the characters but quit after that. The biggest reason is technical. i've double checked a couple of times now and my system exceeds the recommended specs and i still get single digit frame rates, even with all the options turned low. This is surprising given that Mass Effect is nowhere near as pretty as other games that play just fine on my PC (Bioshock, Gears of War, Stranglehold, etc.). i don't normally have problems playing games, but this one is ridiculously slow. At a minimum, they should change their minimum and recommended specs.

The game is unstable, and when it crashes, it tends to crash your whole system. It's been a long time since i've had to reboot my PC three times an hour. i've installed the patch and done all the standard things (latest drivers, etc.) but this game just doesn't want to stay up. i know some of the problems are related to the anti-copying Secure-ROM software (which many people here have already said is unethical; at a minimum, it should tell users it will be installed and give them a way to uninstall it when they uninstall the game). My review isn't based on the ethics of Secure-ROM but i can say that it's caused me to reboot at least once. Most problems, though, i'm guessing are because the port from XBox to PC wasn't done very well.

As for the game, it's your standard Bioware game. You've probably played others and know if you like them or not. They're not for everyone. If you look at their history, Bioware has slowly moved from making role-playing games to making movies. It's well known to game designers that it's hard to get both a strong plot and open, flexible gameplay. Some games try hard (e.g., GTA) but Bioware realizes its talent is in story telling, not graphics, AI or level design (none of which the game does well; the AI is a surprising step backwards from Jade Empire but still better then KotOR). Continuing that trend, Mass Effect is a lot like watching cut scenes with occasional game play. Oddly, a lot of that game play is first person shooter. Bioware does not make good first person shooters. With the FPS aspect, the game actually feels a lot like Deus Ex, a game many people liked, but not as an FPS.

The story, characters, quests, etc. are probably pretty good. i can't say i'm in love with many of the characters (Rex is OK, but not as much fun as HK-47 or Boo). It doesn't seem as good as Jade Empire but it does offer significantly more places to explore than that game did. The love plot, a staple of all recent Bioware games, isn't done very well here (at least when i played a female character). i can't tell you how the game story, subquests, etc. turn out over the long run because i gave up on the game (80% technical reasons, 20% boredom).

As always, the graphics are serviceable but not impressive. Levels are linear and make the world feel very small (Bioware has a talent at making a major city feel like it was the size of an average high school). You still can only select two allies and you have no control over them. That's always been a ridiculous limitation which i assume they use to compensate for the poor pathfinding. Bioware AI tends to be towards the bottom end of the AAA game developers.

But you don't buy a Bioware game to, um, play a game. Bioware games are epic stories containing characters with character. If you liked previous Bioware games (or Deus Ex) and don't mind the new console FPS-like combat system, you'll probably enjoy this game.

For starters, comparing this game to Oblivion is a joke.  The framerate in Two Worlds is stuttery, the menu system is clunky, the collision detection (especially in combat) is inconsistent, the controls for horseriding is unresponsive (usually delayed by at least a second or two), and the difficulty is ridiculously inconsistent.

Even though the difficulty is unpredictable, the game is very forgiving since it allows you to ""respawn"" at the nearest healing statue without any penalty.  And, after you find a two-handed weapon, the collision detection is much less an issue than it is with a one-handed weapon.

But, definitely the most amusing and satisfying aspect of this game is the horrible dialogue and God-awful voice acting that will never get old to me.  The voice acting is an attempt at mimicing ""Olde English,"" but it is a miserable (and hilarious) failure, since it sounds like nothing more than ""American"" English with words like ""Perchance, Mayhap, Methinks, Tis"" and so on injected into the dialogue.

It sounds annoying, and I'm sure it is for most people, but I can't help but belly laugh at the overacting and absurd dialogue.  Take this quote for example, ""You've had a touch of the sunstroke, methinks.  Perhaps you should drink some water and lie down for a while.""

Another charm (which could also be called an annoyance, depending on your sense of humor) is your character's tendency to talk to himself in the most stupid ways imaginable.  After attempting to pick a lock and failing, my character showed his genius by saying out loud ""Hmmm, it's locked.""  Gee, ya think?  Another good one is when it starts to rain, several seconds later your character will wittingly say ""It's starting to rain.""  Brilliance!

If you didn't think any of that was funny, then don't bother with this title.  If you've never played Oblivion, now is a good time.  If you have and want another title of the same caliber, don't even try this game out.  Just play Oblivion again.

If you wish to try it anyway, I definitely suggest going in with a sense of humor and you may come out with some amusement.  Or maybe I should say it like this: ""When playing Two Worlds, perchance you will have some amusement methinks, if mayhap you have a sense of humor.""",I'd say give it a 4 if you have a sense of humor,1188604800,6,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

So, I got Titanfall.  That and the special controller.  Best Buy had it just sitting there.  One left.  Here are my thoughts.
Titanfall is the best looking One game I have.  The first one that looks crisp and clean.  The controls work great on the game.  I never have a problem moving around or doing whatever it is that I need to do.

Now for the problems.  Haha

Ok, firstly, can you say chaos?  The game starts, I move around, kill the enemy, move around, level complete.  What the hell?  That is what I thought the first day I played.  As soon as I start getting into the game, its over.  I understand there are things that must be done, but Ive not a clue what they are.  The game seems to just sits you in a location and gives you a task.  They do not do a very good job of letting you know why your doing it or, as I said, even what your doing.  I almost feel like I am watching a video of other people playing.  It just never feels like a game.  Perhaps its just me.

I guess that is all I will say about the game.  While it looks good, and may be fun, I never actually get the chance to get into it.  I wish I would have rented it first.

Great monster and item variety.  If you know what to expect, then you can have a lot of mindless fun with the game engine.

Probably the best part of the game is defending the villages, with the villagers fighting along side you.  I thought that part was inspired, as far as hack and slash games go.

On the flipside, the game was rushed into fancy packaging without being complete.  The story is minimal.  It's apparent (I'm not an excellent coder) that twelve hours (one work day!) of touch-ups on the story (have the villagers say different things each month) and a bestiary like Castlevania: Curse of Darkness would have improved the experience.  I didn't like the game because the slapdash programming was so obvious.

Cabela really should have took the time on this game. but they didnt, they seemingly just made it and threw it altogether without a thought but to gain profit. Now i aint downing Cabela because they make the best dad gum hunting games. but this was just horrible. I love to use the bow on hunting games, and the bullistics on this game are just impossible and make the game horrible. You have to get within 70 yrds with the compound for a clean kill, 30 with the recurve in real life. Sadly, they didn't seem to realize that the stealth meter is so lame, It was obviously made to be hunting with firearms. Rifles to be specific as the shotgun is about like shooting a handgun on that game. So let me refrain, give you a little idea of what your buying.  First gun i used to go hunting was the 223. handgun that shoots rifle loads. i crept up on a blacktail and glassed it with binoculars, at about 180 yrds. I was crouched, which is supposed to up your stealth meter, but unless you don't move, it drops real low even while crouched, so you'd be better off running. the Buck was laying down with its back to me, i pulled out my pistol and realised i was too far away for a decent shot, i sprayed scent cover and crept forward. As soon as i pushed the analog stick the stealth meter dropped down and the buck up and bolted. Frustrated i fired a shot at it with the 223.and bullet cam was on, so i got to watch the bullet go straight to the ground at the bucks feet as he bolted over the hill and into  the blue. Leaving me to think how bad the ballistics on the game sucked and how that should of hit him. a 223. doesnt begin to drop until 250 yrds. i was well within the range of a straight shot but failed, due to bad ballistics. The bow is impossible, you'll never get close enough to actually hit your target, the game aint designed that way. Finally after too many failed shots to count, i began to just chase em' down with the truck or atv and jump off right by em' and pluck em' like a madman with my 357. which if thats cabelas game designers idea of close range hunting, thats extremely funny. However the 270. rifle and sly planning led to me nearly beating even this impossible caper of a game.

Bottom line: appallingly mediocre game.

After the treat DA:O was, it's sequel is a joke. It's a dumbed-down, consolized, brainless button-masher.

The Good:

Without doubt the biggest sequel highlight is its revamped combat which has been greatly improved and can even be great at times. Although it needs some tweaking to tone down combat movement speed and remove unrealistic ninja-type actions (i.e. triple summersault leaps in mid-air 10 ft high or teleporting constantly).

- Better graphics than it's predecessor but still under par with current games standards (Witcher 2, Skyrim etc.)
- Improved combat system
- Much improved specialisation (abilities) tree. (i.e. cross-class combos)
- Cinematic combat mechanics
- Pretty environments
- Relatively bug-free
- The hero (excuse me, Champion) now talks.
- Re-used dungeons allow you to know where everything already is beforehand saving time ""exploring"".
- Junk loot is automatically stashed in your inventory trash

Tha Bad:

Where to start? So many problems, ranging from game-breakers to petty issues.

- Where's the epic? The publicity said: ""Embark upon an epic adventure that shapes itself around every choice you make"". The story is not epic at all; just some bloke hanging around in the same town doing petty repetitive chores for over 10 years. On top of it, years are fast-forward without your input. Additionally, as I go into detail scrolling further down, your decision-making is non-consequential as the same outcome results regardless of your choices 95% of the time. Tried and tested. This being an RPG is clearly a game-breaker for me. Why bother putting options at all then? Bethany dying you say? Oh please, you can do better than that.
- Poor storyline (BioWare et tu?). Feels linear and predictable.
- Poor plot. We are missing an antagonist (an Arl Howe to hate and chase down). Story is just a string of incoherent sidequests which you couldn't care less for.
- Lack of immersion
- Shallow Companions, nowhere near DA:O. You cannot even interact/start conversations with them unless in the appropriate location i.e. Merrill's house or Ander's clinic.
- Looong loading screens reminiscent of Resident Evil days.
- Whatever happened to Morrigan and the child? Bring her back!
- Recycled environments ad nauseam. You will play in the same dungeon over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. Re-pe-ti-tion. They just block a door but you can still see other unaccessible rooms in your mini-map. Or they make you enter a dungeon you've seen before 20 times from the rear end so you don't notice it's the same one you've been trudging for the prior 12 quests. So lame and lazy. It would seem like a joke only the prank is on you for spending 43 pounds on this crap game.
- Sreamline abuse = removal of core key features that constituted the personal hallmark of the DA franchise. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
- Removal of Origin stories
- You can only play as a Human, unlike DA:O
- Removed coercion option in dialogue
- Removed customization (which is not equal to charactization btw, in case you forgot)
- Removed steal option for rogues
- Watered-down romance, downright bland
- Removal of beautiful love song during romance/sex scenes
- Removed ""harder core"" sex scenes
- Removal of crossbows (except Varric's, which you can't use anyway)
- Awful combat speed a la ninja. Can't see what the heck is going on.
- Rogues ridiculously overpowered. One backstab and Hawke's entire energy bar goes down. (Rogues teleporting..really?)
- Enemies materialise out of thin air in successive waves killing tactics as you do not know from where they will come next or how many there are. This flaw kills weaker ranged units such as archers and mages. Lame
- Prerendered cut scenes forcing combat starting positions which effectively negate player manual tactical positioning. We cannot think like generals if you guys already make the starting moves for us
- Music composition nowhere near as good and epic as DA:O
- Removal of trap-making for Rogue-types
- Removal of poison-making
- Removal of rune-crafting
- Rogues frequently cannot detect traps ! Eg level 11 rogue, with 25 cunning, in Act 1 Deep Roads shortly after meeting Sandal in a large square room with only one ogre. There are 3 or 4 traps that went undetected. WTF?
- Removal of cool animated finishing moves
- Elves look retarded
- Beards look terrible
- Removal of different enemy clases. Enemies are now mostly generic. Variety gone. Hurlocks, Genelocks anyone?
- Unable to customise Companion armour. Lame and lazy!!
- Atrezzo repetition: ox-carts spam dungeons and streets. Again lazy.
- Rogues make enemies explode at the touch of a blade (very stupid and unrealistic)
- Almost the whole disjointed story takes place within one venue, a city, Kirkwall. Moreover, within said city, you are trudging in no more than 8 re-used dungeons. So much for exploring a fantasy land. Do you remember than on dying there's a pop-up that says ""Your journey ends...""? That's because you are meant to be exploring the lands, not being a lab rat memorising the same dungeon over and over again. For example, Bethesda has hired 8 dungeon-designers for Skyrim. Please spend more coin next time in level-design.
- Removal of random encounters whilst travelling from one location to another, whether fights or merchants
- Removal of camp-time. This was a fantastic feature that made you know and feel for your companions. Why not do the same in the Hanged Man for example?
- Shameful recycle of Codex from DA:O
- Darkspawn look comical (Skeletor clones)
- Way too much worthless junk loot
- Generic names cause inventory confusion: ring, belt, boots, amulet etc...
- Stupid menial sidequests that take 3 minutes, or less, to complete. Abuse of ""fetch-type"" (fed ex) quests that feel like tedious repetitive chores (""I found this, I believe its yours""); thanks but no thanks, I already have my life for that. Pitiful reward for completing most of them. You really have to force yourself to finish this game, least you ignore the side quests...
- Ridiculous amount of experience awarded for finding crafting elements i.e 205 points
- Lazy system of potion-making/rune-crafting (over-simplified)
- Generally dumbed-down from predecessor. (I'm not even talking about combat)
- Major flaw: decisions bear no real impact on story as the same outcome happens regardless of your choices 95% of the time (tried and tested). Why bother putting options at all? It's just cosmetic. This is truly a game-breaker for me and the proverbial straw on the camel's back. The game feels linear like ME2 and this is a BioWare RPG gentlemen, or so it says on the back of my box. Now what was Daniel Erikson's 2010 definition of an RPG again? Hmmm...?
- Terrible ending
- Stupid conversation wheel imported from ME2.
- Embarrassing simple dialogue options: bad, funny, good. With pictures in case you are confused (with a heart for romance) which option to pick. Quit the hand-holding, we are not 3-year olds.
- Clearly rushed game (Da money rulz EA)
- Poor dialogue compared to DA:O
- Hard difficulty is easy, nightmare difficulty is way too difficult. Unbalanced. Nightmare is just a war of attrition in which enemies have huge health bars that are chipped away ever so slowly (i.e. giant spider, rock wraith) that hinges on how many health potions you have in your inventory.
- Another particularly annoying and unpractical battle animation, albeit cool, are mages wand-waving when enemies are drawing near. This is very troubling on playing on nightmare difficulty because while 3 shades are approaching at 3m distance and I'm frantically clicking on the ""A"" button, my mage disregards my commands as he's apparently too busy swirling his wand around showing off only to be killed 3 seconds later. Not cool, please tone down or remove.
- Major combat flaw: on fighting on large open spaces, such as Hightown, the team members may spread out. Imagine I switch from my rogue over to Anders because he's being ragdolled. On switching over the tv screen freezes, turns black and a pop-up appears with a ""loading..."" message. It takes 4-5 seconds to actually come off and take control of Anders. This is bad enough but the problem is that the fight has continued in real time and by the time the 5 seconds are over he's already dead. And here comes the worse; when I switch over back to my rogue the screen freezes -again-, turns black and the loading message comes up -again- having to wait yet another 5 seconds to take full control of my rogue by which time he's also dead on playing at nightmare level. On nightmare one cannot afford to completely lose control of the team for 10 seconds or more. This flaw needs to be addressed ASAP.

In conclusion

If you like deep, rich, epic immersive storylines in a cRPG where you get to visit and explore a fantasy land, such as the ones BioWare was renowned for, you may want to look elsewhere. DA2 will not appeal to you. You have been warned.

If you rather enjoy casual, laid-back action adventure games, that don't require much thinking, but are taxing on your button-mashing abilities, look no further; Dragon Age 2 is your kind of game. Moreover, if you liked DA2's demo, you'll love it.

If you loved its predecessor, Dragon Age: Origins, like me, you will probably dislike DA2 which is a completely different game that only bears the same name; similarities end there.

My advice: rent it first before buying. In my book (RPG lover) this game is clearly the definition of a day-one rental. If you really must have it, wait until the GOTY or when the Ultimate edition is released.

Imo, it's a rushed, consolized game devised to cash-in unashamedly on DA:O's success. The franchise has made the -failed- transition from the cRPG genre over to the ""Action""-RPG genre (consolization or casualization, whatever) with the aim to broaden its fanbase (EA making more bucks whilst BioWare sells itself out) on the wake of Mass Effect's 2 success.

Utter betrayal of loyal fanbase.

It's the RPG equivalent of the disservice Xbox's Civilization Revolution did for the classic PC Civilization franchise i.e. remove grey matter and substitute it for ""an awesome thing will happen on pressing da button"" (sic)

The only way to actually like this game and give it a 5 (doesn't deserve more) is if you completely forget DA:O AND ignore the fact this game is actually a sequel to one of the greatest all-time RPG's. So if you are able of the afore feat and disregard there's a ""2"" slapped right at the end of DA you may think this game is okish. In fact, if DA2 had been done by a third party, I would say meh, give it a 5, and wouldn't have even bothered to waste my time reviewing at length, moving on to a true RPG game.

But as it turns out, it's a BioWare game. Well my friend, it isn't ok, its garbage. The game was marketed and sold as an ""epic"" sequel to an existing consolidated franchise; not as a non-related DLC which is what DA:2 really is. The only thing epic about DA2 is its failure by all accounts.

If ain't broke, don't fix it.

DA:O was already the commercially (and critically) successful blueprint on which DA2 should have build and improved upon. Why such a radical departure (180 degrees) from an already consolidated and highly profitable franchise with an existing fanbase? DA2 fixes successfully everything that was NOT broken from DA:O.

The changes made to DA2 are not in line with those brought about by ME2 in respect to ME1. Streamlining made sense in ME2 because it improved the gameplay redunding in a better user experience without detracting from ME's personality, or at least not that much. DA2 radical departure are no improvement, they make for a completely different game that alienates the existing fanbase which had different expectations more in line with the original game. The sequel, let us not forget, was sold on the piggyback of the first installment.

They said: ""Think like a general, play as a Spartan"". More like mash button ""A"" until first wave of enemies are wiped out. Take a pause so your white knuckles recover, rinse and repeat. Hack-fest at its best. Dungeon Siege developers would be teary-eyed proud of DA:2.

Not up to BioWare's standards. Easily this years' biggest disappointment.

Contender to Skyrim or the Witcher 2? Ha ha ha, what a joke. Serious contender to occupy the racks of second-hand games in your nearest gaming store along with Kane & Lynch and Homefront within three weeks of its release.

BioWare get your act together or you risk alienating your fanbase, you know, us who pay your mortgages. One more red strike like this and you are out BioWare, for good.

And finally let me close this review with some friendly advice. Companies should never mess-up with their customers, specially long-time hardcore fans, much less mistreat them or insult them. And that goes for Mr Laidlaw, DA2's lead designer, and his ridiculous interviews.

Multiplayer. You spend most your time working through loading screens, stat screens, ready screens, character input screens and character introductions that very little time is actually spent playing the game. Opting out of the game is also very difficult, as there is only one screen that you are able to do so. It is extremely difficult to find someone to play that doesn't lag. I live in San Francisco with a great cable connection, and this is just inexcusable how the game only matches me with players with low pings, and how difficult it is to find people to play. The experience is like you wait and wait for someone to join, and they're either: away or too lagged to play.

Player Base. Most players hover around one fighter. Other fighting games are designed so that you can have fun with multiple players. Not SF4. The reason: it is so prohibitively difficult to get any sort of advantage that you're spent using a select few fighters (Ryu, Ken, Zangief, Abel, etc.) I am absolutely shocked if a opponent picks anyone other than Ken.

Square Gate. For some reason Capcom decided that the original dragon punch motion was too difficult to pull off. Their solution: redesign the joystick's 'gate' (or the restrictor plate that lies underneath the joystick) from a fluid circular motion to a square. This makes it so that your joystick is drawn to the corners, but the top, bottom, left and right don't sit well so your joystick just slides to the corner. Very frustrating when you're trying to block high - you'll either jump back or block low. Doing 360 Zangief or fireball motions are very difficult as well, as your joystick rotates it knicks and knacks across the corners. This square gate's purpose was to facilitate the dragon punch input change, which is also counter-intuitive. You crouch forward then back then forward? Sorry, this was just a bad change. None of the other Street Fighter games have this feature.

Timing. Capcom really messed this up. Most fireballs knock you down, killing the momentum of the game. Most moves have a delay between input and action, so you must plan ahead to absurd degrees. They slowed down the game to make it more like Street Fighter 2, but this was a bad move. Remember Super Street Fighter 2 and how slow that was after the awesome Street Fighter Turbo? They changed Super when they updated the game, and none of the other Street Fighter games were that slow. But - there's a reason why Capcom slowed the game down! Read on...

Combos. Combos are prohibitively awkward. There are still the 'simple' move cancel combos that made Street Fighter famous. And there's Supers and Ultras, which are nice. But trying to combo into an Ultra is often times an exercise. Jump in with a punch, then tap jab twice and move cancel into a special - as that special connects,  focus cancel (medium punch + medium kick), tap forward twice - then do the ultra move. This is typical and is such an awkward bunch of commands it requires a painstaking amount of practice to get right (or even remember). I didn't even mention the 'EX' moves, where you must press more than 1 punch or kick button at a time. Good thing Capcom knew how difficult they were and included Trials that show you a lot of these combos. Good luck, you'll need it.

These commands must be input very fast, with precise timing for the combos to pull off. The real reason why Capcom slowed the game down. Great, thanks a lot.

Counters. In previous Street Fighter games certain specials and other moves would counter different attacks. It was a pretty simple concept. Even in Street Fighter 3 with EX specials it made sense (but was a huge step up in difficulty, especially with the parrying technique). In SF4 it is taken to a ridiculous degree. For one, EX moves pretty much counter anything. That loses a lot of the breathtaking gameplay that made the original so great. They totally defeat the purpose of the regular specials counters, when if you want to counter a move all you need to do is press another punch or kick button. Yay! Second, removing parrying made sense as it was very difficult to learn and unfair for players that did know it, but introducing Focus Attacks just slows the game down. Making it so you can time a ridiculously animated Focus Attack while an opponent is getting up - and landing it into some super-over-powered ultra move to end the match just makes it a silly magic trick.

In previous Street Fighter games you really felt proud of a win, because you had to use cunning and tactics to win. In SF4, the more combos, Focus Attack or EX counters you learn will determine whether you win or not. The feeling is not pride in outsmarting your opponent, but out-learning him.

After the excellent Street Fighter 3 and Alpha series, Street Fighter 4 is just such a disappointment that I feel sad that it will probably be years before we see a Street Fighter that is fun again. If ever.",Massively Disappointed,1272585600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It's uniqueness in lack of violence is what makes it a jewel.  If you have an itch to fight in dungeons, play the Legend of Zelda games! The way the stamina bars are set up makes it very limiting to how much you can do in a day.  I also didn't like the whole catching your monsters (livestock) in the caves.

2.0,False,"12 27, 2008",AZFHSPEZUPGD2,B001EQPDNS,Carol M,"I found this game is entertaining at first, but it quickly became tedious due to the repetition.

There are 20 ""missions"", each consisting of a few paragraphs of a journal and 5 game ""levels"".  Each level has a search-and-find puzzle, and then a mini-game.  The mini-game's picture or background is the basis for the next search and find puzzle.

With 20 missions and 5 levels per mission, you are doing the search-and-find 100 times.  But there are only 18 different scenes.  So each scene is used 5 or 6 times.  The image is exactly the same each of those times, but the list of things to find varies.  A particular thing to find won't be on the list every time you visit the scene, but it may show up 3 or 4 times.  You quickly memorize where certain key items are within each scene.

You are also doing the mini-games 100 times.  But there are only 5 different games.  So each game is done 20 times.  How many times can you play the memory game before you are bored to tears?  Also, the mini-game variety is tied to whichever search screen comes next.  That means that even though you do the jigsaw puzzle game 20 times, there are only 4 different jigsaw puzzle pictures.  You do the same exact jigsaw puzzle 5 times!  The same is true for the tile swap puzzles - there are only 4 pictures, and you get to do each of those pictures multiple times.  Yay.

There is no aspect of collecting clues and solving a mystery.  You are simply reading the 20 journal entries describing an archaeologist searching for the ruins.  The only tie between the gaming activities and the story is the imagery.  And the imagery does not change as the story progresses.

The ending is anti-climatic.  You get a final journal entry, then a message saying ""You found the ancient ruin.  Do you want to do the bonus screen?""  And then a chance to do a 19th search-and-find.

At the same time, I was also a little weary. I used to LOVE the talent behind Obsidian. This, after all, is a studio formed by many of the top talent that formerly worked at Interplay and the much-venerated Black Isle Studios. Between 9 and 12 years ago, I went through some of the best gaming experiences thanks to the original Fallout games, Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale. Despite this rich history, starting with Star Wars: KOTOR II Obsidian's products have become progressively worse. KOTOR II had a great story but was mired by several bugs and, well...depending on how you made certain choices, large chunks of the story towards the endgame unfolded without a shred of logic. Then they delivered Neverwinter Nights 2, which again had everything going for it, except for some horrendous bugs. At least one bug was game-breaking.

It is the same story with Alpha Protocol. While the plot is serviceable, and the dialogue system is fairly engaging, the rest of the game leaves much to be desired. Graphics, character models and animations are clunky and laughable. From the very first trailer, the game looked long in the teeth. What is shocking is the fact that they used the Unreal 3.0 engine and still botched it up. No its not the best engine out there (*kaff* Crytek *kaff*), but its capable of building some pretty nifty looking worlds.

The sound is very average. Personally I've heard worse voice acting, especially in some of the European imports. The music fits the mood (some plain Bond/Bourne rip-offs) but doesn't have much character.

Gameplay is mostly bad, but there are a few bright spots. The gunplay is wonky - and is particularly frustrating if you, like myself, spent a couple of months earlier this year with Commander Shepard and Co. Mini-games like hacking get old fast, but that's a complaint I have about mini-games in a lot of RPGs. Surprisingly I like the time-limit in the dialogue choices. It really makes you feel like you are a spy under pressure and its quite a thrill to decide someone's fate in the space of 5 seconds. I also like the weapons/skill customization - which is fleshed out properly enough.

A glaring hole is the (non-existent) artificial intelligence. My favorite bug is when baddies keep on climbing up and down the same ladder for no reason whatsoever.

As far as plot goes...its okay. But then again story has never been Obsidian's weakness. I can see two reasons why Alpha Protocol turned out the way it did. One: Obsidian just wanted to shove this out the door when they inked the deal to develop Fallout New Vegas. And two: They just don't have a good game development process in place. Which is a pity, given the good writers on staff.

I hope Obsidian is taking note as I am certainly not the only individual feeling this way. After this mess, I doubt I'll blindly go out and buy Fallout New Vegas - original developers or no (I am so bloody scared about how it turns out!) From now on, Obsidian is going to have to work hard to get my hard-earned money.

My advice to prospective buyers: wait till the game hits the sub $30 mark - give it 6 to 12 months. Actually you are better of re-visiting an old RPG like The Witcher or something.

I must say, I was disappointed and only played it a few times.  I just couldn't get into it.  For several reasons.  The graphics are ok and it's pretty cool how you can see your own breath and all the ice on the walls, but the sound is terrible.  I  have this installed on Vista x64 with just the built in Realtek sound on the motherboard, but it's distorted.  When in a loud atmosphere, the sound clips, crackles and even completely drops out.  Very annoying.  I've tried tinkering with the settings of my soundcard and in-game, but nothing helped.  Maybe it's supposed to be that way, but I sure hope not.  The game play is also pretty cheesy.  I kept having to touch these bodies and having flashbacks of when I crashed through the ice or something. Another thing that's stupid, is that your health is your body heat.  That's right.  If you get hit by an enemy, it drains your warmth.  How do you get more energy?  You have to restore your warmth by taking off your gloves and sticking your hands by a lightbulb or some other source of heat.  An original idea, but really stupid.  When you see a dead body, you are given a chance to ""save his soul"".  What happens, is you touch the dead frozen body and you are transported back to the past, where the event in which the guy died is re-created and you have a chance to change his fate by doing whatever it is you need to do to save his life.  Usually this is time limited.  If you don't do the even correctly, the dream scene ends and you have to try it again... and again.. and again....  and again...... and again...  and again..... and again.... until you get it right.  Well this annoyed the crap out of me and I stopped playing the game.

Aside from that, the overall controls are JUNK.  For example, when you are punching,  you control the type and direction of the punch with the mouse.  yeah.  You hit the button, to punch then push the mouse forward to do a jab, press the button and pull the mouse back for an uppercut, then side to side and when you ad in blocking and dodging, this is just too much of a pain.

(Now, I feel stupid for having thought that.)  So, the game does tend to open one's eyes to the horrors of war and what those men went through.

Actually, the primary problem I have with this game is that it's too difficult.  Now, before anyone dismisses me for a wimp, let me just say that I love difficult and challenging games.  But there are levels of difficulty in most games (this particular one included).  Usually, it's ""Easy,"" ""Medium,"" and ""Hard"" - or something along those lines.  My point is, if they wanted a super-hard game to show the player how tough war is, then they very easily could have provided those difficulties on the harder levels.  For me, this game has no re-playability on even the easy level, much less the more difficult ones.

The difficulty of this game is not to be compared to other popular first-person-shooters like the Jedi series, GHOST RECON, the HALF-LIFE series, or even MEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT.  Those games and many others like them present certain difficulties, but after the player moves past the difficult part, there's time to catch one's breath a bit.  In SPEARHEAD, it's constant action with no time or opportunity to stop and enjoy the game.  I realize this is war.  But it's also a game.  In fact, it's a game first.  And these two must be carefully balanced in order for the game to be a quality product.

This game is not a quality product.",Definitely not MEDAL OF HONOR quality!,1105920000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

2.0,False,"12 23, 2008",A6VI02LR3Z3BW,B000X9FV5M,Moxibustion,"The original FarCry is still one of my favourite shooters of all time. FarCry2 whilst having a  similar title, is however something of a departure from the original FarCry. The plot seems based on the book 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad, whereby we see western characters bringing moral chaos into Africa (the games setting) through gun running and other activites. You are sent in to this setting with the mission of killing the Jackal - the chief gun runner and arms dealer causing this moral chaos. For those that have seen the idea portrayed in the film 'Apocalypse Now' you will get the idea. This plot is revealed through finding tapes that reveal the Jackals descent into moral darkness along the way in similar fashion to how the plot developed in Bioshock. Despite the same name as the original, FarCry2 is a whole different game, perhaps closest in concept to STALKER. FarCry2 is a giant sandbox whereby you get to do whatever it is that you please and tackle the game in any manner that you want, very similar in concept to how STALKER functioned. STALKER was a fantastic game and should be played by anyone interested in shooters and first person style RPGs. FarCry2 however fails to implement the elements needed in quite the same fashion as STALKER and the game quickly becomes boring and repetitive. There are almost no RPG elements that stalker has and so the tasks that FarCry2 asks you to accomplish become pointless and unimaginative. The world that is created is missing a few things, like civilians, and people living their lives, refugees and hence offers you no reason to feel at home in the enviroment, build a house, or setup a base (such as you might do in Oblivion and like). The world is populated by people that simply want to kill you, they will attack even if they have no chance of success and so in the course of the game your moral compass will shift from seeing if the person is a friendly to murdering people in their cars with flame throwers so they won't irritate you by running you off the road. In this sense the game actually succeeds in advancing the plot so you find the 'Heart of Darkness', but not because of the storytelling, but because everything in the game is so annoying that you just want it to die. As much as I wanted to like this game I found myself playing it to completion for the sake of liberating my hard drive space for something better - never a good sign. How come nobody can do a remake of the original FarCry but update the graphics and add a bunch of new levels or something. How good would that be. I am starting to think that the original was a fluke. The games magazines give this an impressive rating, meanwhile the gaming community has panned it - why do we still buy those magazines.

Stability: Stable, for the most part other than the X-Fi problem. If you have an X-Fi and an nForce chipset then many have experiences snaps and crackling with the sound. I had this problem and could not resolve it. So if your system is suspect to this as mine is then FarCry2 is the worst affected that I have found. Other than sound I did not experience any crashes whilst playing in 50hrs of gameplay.

Graphics: Inevitably this is going to be measured up against Crysis. Is FarCry2 as impressive as Crysis in the graphics department - nope, but I would argue that it is good enough nonetheless. It is similar is quality to Half-Life 2, but perhaps closest in look and feel to Soldier of Fortune Payback - for those who played that game. FarCry2 is slightly drabber that the brighter and more sprightly look is SOF Payback, but the feel is the same. I enjoyed the environment for the most part even if it got repetitive after awhile. Overall the feel and look of the environment is well done, though doesn't vary much like FarCry The Original did. The irony is that SOF Payback might be the better game.

Sound: Apart from the X-Fi problem I mentioned the sound track fits quite well to the environment and doesn't ever feel annoying or out of place. However the sound affects are only better than average, though the atmospheric sounds do their job. There is also a sound positioning problem for those running 5.1 setups however the patch designed to fix this didn't work so well for me.

Gameplay: This is the problem area. Whereas STALKER managed to mix the sandbox idea with an RPG system, with sound and NPCs really well as well as immersing you in a believeable environment, FarCry2 is really a let down in this department. The weapons never really improve, you cannot upgrade your car, you never develop any real friends in the game and the gameplay is a snoozefest. My wife was watching over my shoulder one night as I was playing and she said 'Isn't this boring?' Couldn't have said it better myself. FarCry worked because it kept the open ended part of the game only big enough to allow variety in how to get to an objective. STALKER worked because it allowed RPG elements that affected what you could do in the game and gave incentive for going out and exploring and becoming enveloped in the story. FarCry2 does neither of these things, it just gives a massive gameworld with nothing interesting to do it. No villages to save, no homes to make, no affecting the game in any real way, just tedious driving and console like diamond hunts. Doing console tasks on a PC is a drag, as is FarCry2. The game might have worked better if you went down a long river and got to upgrade your barge without having to go anywhere twice (Apocalyse Now anyone?) Too late to speculate now.

Length: Took me about 50 hours (including wasting my time finding all of the diamonds - a  pointless task since you get more than enough money). This is a good standard by today's games, howeever one has to question whether is is 50 quality hours. I argue for the negative, Farcry2 has its moments but these only amount to about 3-4 hours worth.
Replayability: I didn't bother with multiplayer as I have no friends who own the game, and  perhaps they are wise as they wish not too. If you find clipping your toenails to be exhilirating then this could be the game for you.

Verdict: 2.5/5. In the end a mediocre effort, an impressive presentation but lacked fun. A far  cry from the original (pun intended).

The changes this game had was very impressive when I first played it. The graphics are just simply amazing as compared to previous years. However graphics don't make a game great...they can make them good, but not great. However Madden 09 has a ton of problems that void it from even being called GOOD...and this is from a very big fan of the series.

PROS
1. Updated Graphics Look Great. Again, I was very impressed.
2. Game Is A Lot Harder. One would wonder why this is a PRO, but it makes the game more of a challenge instead of being able to murder the computer every game. It can get frustrating, but I think it's something that adds a more realistic feel to the game.

CONS
1. Freeze problem. What everyone is saying is the TRUTH. I've had this problem happen to me over 10+ times since I bought the game (on the day it came out.) It will hit you during a game, after a game, going through the games menu, and basically everywhere else. I've never had this happen in the earlier Madden games. This is a very disappointing issue with the game. I've won the Super Bowl every season in my franchise except for one year, and every single time the game ends and I go to exit to the menu, it froze. So I would have to go back and just sim it until I won. It happens way to much, and when I'm in the menu I find myself saving every second. I hate feeling like any minute the game is going to freeze. NO ONE IS SAFE.
2. No Franchise Practice Mode. I couldn't remember if the previous games had the ability to practice with your actual franchise team...and if so, then Madden 09 abandoned that feature. I like being able to practice with my current team and get a feel for who can do what in different situations. But without that option you basically just have to play and see what they can do.
3. Custom Playbook/Franchise Mode. You can not create a playboy and use it in a franchise mode. I was looking forward to creating an offense and defensive playbook and using it in the franchise....but you can't. So I was let down.
4. Sideline Players. This is kind of stupid, but you think by now they would do something with the sideline players. I was watching a reply from a play I did and noticed that I saw a 350 Pound Player wearing #12. I was the Packers, therefore I'm talking about QB Aaron Rodgers. They just threw people on there like always, but seriously...have the guy look somewhat like the people. Or atleast have them jump up and down when you score.
5. Rewind Option Is Lame. I never use it. I don't see the point of it. When playing in 2 player mode, the rewind option (the ability to rewind the play and start over again if you make a mistake) is crazy. You can basically be playing your friend who will throw an interception and you get the ball back. He will see how many rewinds he has and then use one. The play will rewind back to the snap of the ball and he gets another shot at it. S-T-U-P-I-D!!

I would seriously wait for Madden 2010 and see what it has to offer. This would would be ""Ok"" if it wasn't for the freezing issue.

The game is visually amazing, yes, but when you get to World 5, things get pretty insane...enough to throw your controller at the screen and give up after 50 stars (which is exactly and proudly what I did).

You see, the thing is that once you get to World 5, you need 55 stars to get to World 6.

2.0,False,"10 22, 2010",ADLVFFE4VBT8,B0028IBTLG,Cthulhu,"I am going to say this upfront. My initial plan was to wait until New Vegas' GOTY edition became available and then buy a used copy. Not because I didn't enjoy playing Fallout 3 - I did - but because I expected for other games to keep me occupied for the next couple of months. Sadly, the Two Worlds 2 - a promising RPG - release got postponed to ""early 2011"", GT5 followed suit with their own delay, ArcaniA (Gothic 4) too won't be available on the PS3 until March next year and, based on the PC version reviews I've seen, it may not be a worthy one so... New Vegas was the only decent new RPG actually available for purchase these days. So, here's my review, following my first 20 hours of play.

THE STORY LINE

I am not too far in the game at the time I'm writing this and revealing the plot wouldn't be a good thing to do anyway. But, it's probably safe to say that at least the main plot line is 'you' waking up in a doctor office after being shot in the head and then trying to understand 'why' it happened and 'who' did it or had it done to you and possibly bringing some well-deserved justice to the perpetrators - sounds familiar? It probably does. The stage is the same Fallout 3-like, post-apocalyptic world, only you wake up in a desert town not far from New Vegas and you need to find your way and your place in this world while making sure that you are eaten up or poisoned to death by the local fauna or robbed and dismembered by any of the roving gangs. Oh and, there's Vegas or New Vegas rather so... gambling anyone?

GAMEPLAY

New Vegas is a strictly one-player, off-line experience. It's just you and your game-issued companions (no more than one human and one non-human at any given time) versus 'the world'.

You can peacefully interact with humans and robots by picking one of the several pre-written lines while they talk back to you via spoken words (subtitles available at the bottom of the screen). When you fight you can do it either in real time or through the V.A.T.S system that stops the time and lets you pick which body parts of which enemy you are going to try to hit. The view is either 'first person', suitable when traveling fighting with long range weapons or 'third person' which I personally prefer when doing real-time melees.

The games consists in a series of quests that usually involve finding someone or something and then perform some action: retrieve an item or information, fight or perhaps make an alliance. At any time you can abandon your quest and pick up a new one if available or you can simply roam the land and do things that would help you uplevel and therefore improve your skills. Killing people or non-humans, discovering new locations, unlocking safes or terminals or persuading others to do things for you would grant you experience points. Once a certain threshold is reached you move up another level and have the ability to assign 'points' to your various skills and pick one of the available 'perks'.

As I mentioned before, doing 'bad' things to other people, like launching unprovoked attacks or stealing will damage your general reputation (karma) and also the way you are viewed by the faction whose member you victimized. Of course, if you go for the platinum trophy, you will have to do quite a bit of pick pocketing and other unethical things.

And, speaking of trophies, the game can be played at several levels of difficulty, ranging from 'very easy' to 'very hard' and than there is the 'hardcore mode' which is hellishly hard. And you can only win the platinum if you play the game in 'hardcore' mode from the beginning until the end. If you are not after the platinum, you can switch difficulty levels at any time during gameplay.

BUGS AND OTHER SHORTCOMINGS

I haven't encountered A LOT OF 'serious' bugs but I did get myself stabbed while inside an abandoned bus by someone outside the bus and was able to slash the aggressor back and I did enjoy killing Geckos who, while trying to run away from me ran into a boulder and instead of going around it put themselves into a loop, trying to go through it. And the side of a Death Claw flying high... priceless.

More serious, on a couple of my level-ups I was not given the opportunity to pick a new Perk. I'm not sure if this was part of the game design or it's in fact a bug. One more - and this is an update - my PS3 just froze in a very bad way for no apparent reason other than there being 7 or 8 live enemies on the screen. The crash was so bad, the PS3 button would not get me out of the game and I had to turn off the PS3 from the 'power' button. I found the PS3 to be a VERY STABLE platform that very rarely crashes. If I think of it, the last time it crashed it might have been while playing Fallout 3. This is not good.

Finally, in the 'shortcomings' or serious disappointments category, not unlike its predecessor, the game tends to slow down a lot whenever there is any significant activity on the screen like... several character moving at the same time. I wish the developers took a little time to fix whatever it is that makes Bethesda PS3 games such as Oblivion, Fallout 3 and this New Vegas crawl while similarly complex games by other developers are zipping along.

FALLOUT 3 vs. NEW VEGAS

I expected Fallout: New Vegas to be not unlike Fallout 3. However, I was surprised to see how nearly-identical to Fallout 3 this game is. Even considering the few minor improvements and additions, New Vegas could be easily confused with a Fallout 3 DLC, only a larger than usual one. New Vegas plays inside a square map that, we are told, is comparable in size with that of Fallout 3 and not larger. V.A.T.S., S.P.E.C.I.A.L., the Pip-Boy 3000, the leveling system (new Perks), the way you interact with the environment, the trash you find littered all over the place, even some of the creatures (DeathClaws, Bloatflies), the Vaults, the dirty water, the color of the desert landscape, they should all appear strangely familiar to those who've played Fallout 3 in the past.

I am happy to note quite a few most welcome improvements. Game saves and loading delays are a lot shorter than in Fallout 3, making for a more immersive experience. While only 720p, the image quality appears to be improved. Human characters faces look more human in New Vegas and the lip-syncing is better. While not exactly 'bug free', this release appears to have fewer bugs than its predecessor.

There are, of course, some totally new features in New Vegas. From what I read pre-release, I expected a lot more color but at least the sky is blue, most of the time. Gambling is added, including the very complicated game of Caravan (still learning it), there is some primitive potion-making capability, you get weapon mods and the ability to tinker with your ammo, there is a new interface to interact with your human and non-human companions and, of course, New Vegas comes with the much publicized local reputation - the way certain communities and factions view you based on your past interaction with them. For healing, the SuperStimpacks and the rare Doctor Bags are added.

MY SCORE

New Vegas is in some ways an improvement over Fallout 3 which is good but it it doesn't show a lot of innovation which is a disappointment. While some bugs and shortcomings have been addressed (load/save times) others have not. The New Vegas' story and location may be original but the tools the game makers used to tell the story have only changed a little and, in my view, not enough. I may agree that New Vegas is a 'new game' rather than a Fallout 3 expansion but only barely so.

I will grant New Vegas 3 stars (means ""It's Okay""). As I advance deeper into the game my views may change.

____________________________________________

NOTE 1:

It's probably fair to note that I've bought the Collector's Edition. The game is in no way different - I even got the Tribal Pack extension - but it comes with a great graphic novel (hard cover), playing cards, poker chips, the big platinum chip that got you killed in the first place and a 'the making of...' DVD.

NOTE 2:

Some 35 hours into the game, 2 big crashes later and the 'wow' factor still missing, the temptation is strong to take off another star but, since I am still playing it, the fair thing should be to leave the 3 stars on. Three stars mean ""It's okay"" and that's how I feel about New Vegas at this time.

NOTE 3:

45 hours and the load/save times are getting longer, 3 more crashes. Downgraded to 2 stars.

The graphics are quite amazing.  This is a good first release in terms of showing potential graphical prowess.

The Bad:

The game play gets stale after the first two missions.  Once you figure out the general strike/parry tactic, the rest of the game is just an pain.  The enemies all follow the same general patterns and don't really have any serious differentiation.  They are all just cut and paste.  There are collectibles throughout the game that don't seem to matter.  You can collect them, and they look like they will put some more ""oompf"" into the story, but... no.  Once you pick up a scroll, or a tapestry, or vista, or whatever, that's it.  There is no explanation or further info, just a counter.  Should you collect them all.... nothing.

The game is also insanely short.  For an on-rails button masher, I was hoping for more, but then I played it and realized why it was so short... Players are more than likely bored before the 4th or 5th mission.  At least there, the developers were kind enough to cut the pain short.

I have been a Tolkein fan since 1967 (long, long ago) and when I read the hype on this game and how it stuck to the books by Tolkein (upon which I wrote my college English lit thesis) I decided that this was an adventure game that I really wanted to have.  At the beginning of the game we find Frodo running 'helter skelter' all over the Shire doing mundane... tasks NOT found in the books.  Finally, we finish with that and head to Bywater, very short and sweet and wonder what that was all about.  We head back to Baggend to retrieve the Ring and to hand over the key to Mr. Gamgee which is the beginning of the action genre.  From that point on, I found that I, as Frodo, was totally unable to get out of the Gamgees front yard before I was 'killed' by a Black Rider (after the 7th death, I called it quits and headed here).

However, in the past few months, Sony Online Entertainment has completely scraped the original game coding and rewritten it from scratch.

There used to be 30+ professions to play, and players used to be able to mix them and be hybrids.

Now there are only 9 professions, and players are stuck in their jobs... You wanna be a Smuggler, great your a smuggler, only there is no smuggling existent in the game... and you can't play your favorite Stars Wars musical instrument anymore in the Cantina's... as a side job.

The Combat System in the game has been overhauled at least twice in the last few months, the original system completely scraped and re-coded from scratch.

All these changes to the game are forced upon the players by SOE, and the players have to download them from SOE's servers to make sure their installed version is up to date with SOE's version.

Some of the downloads take hours, some even days for Dial Up users.  I have to burn all the downloaded updates into a CD or DVD for a friend of mine, and mail them to her because she gets them quicker that way.. because her Dial Up takes 36+ hours to download the biggest updates, and she can only let the download run for a few hours a day.

The game, at the present time... November 21st, 2005... the Game sucks.  SOE keeps promising changes to make things better, but they're either not coming fast enough for the players... or they just never come out with the cxhange at all... Smuggler's have been waiting 2 years now for the ""promised"" ability to be able to Smuggle in the game... Players are cancelling their accounts left and right.

SOE, on the day of their latest, and largest recode of the game... two weeks ago, Fired their Community Correspondent (Tiggs, a very popular person with the players) who is their voice between us the Players.. and them... because they didn't like what she was telling them what we were saying about the changes.

The game is supposed to be set in the timeperiod between the first two, Original Movies... Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back...

Yet LucasArts is producing the Expansions for this game and they keep pushing in Episode II and III content... instead of content designed for the correct time line.  Not only that, the new Clone Wars Content... is far better then the current timeline content... which supposed to be 20 years more advanced.

Jedi's... You wanna play a Jedi... this should be called, Star Wars: KOTOR Online.  The Jedi Population is out of control and it was SOE's biggest mistake to allow players to become Jedi's...  They should have left that as a rarity in the game, only had a few NPC Jedi's like Luke Skywalker in the game, as novelties for offering special Quests...

But no... they wanted to let players be Jedi's as a selling point.

How many Jedi did you see charging across the Hoth Battle Field with Luke, to take down the Imperial Walkers?

In Star Wars: Galaxies... there will be several hundred of them out there on Hoth... if SOE and LucasArts ever gets around to adding Hoth.

They're too busy adding Episode II and III content like the planets Kashyyyk and Mustafar... speaking of which, if you're a Jedi then you can go to Mustafar and help save Obi Wan Kenobi's ghost; whose ""lost his way"" ... how lame is that?

Now, they can't remove the Jedi from the game like they should.. because they hyped up being Jedi so much that ""everyone and their mother"" has one, or has played one... and would cry, bitch and comlain if SOE removed them.

SOE is ""claiming"" all these changes are making the game feel more ""Star Wars"" like... however within the last two weeks they have destroyed the in-game player economy, destroyed the orininal 30 Player Professions and redesigned 9 new ones... removed the ability to play a Hybrid Profession.. and turned the game into a massive online FPS that seems like it is based off of the KOTOR Timeline, instead of the Timeline it is supposed to be based off of... and ruined the combat system.

Do not buy this game.

If you want to play a Star Wars game, go play one of the Console Games like Star Wars: KOTOR series... or the new BattleFront series.

At present, this is probably one of the worst Star Wars Games ever made now.

It is all thanks to mismanagement and bad design ideas at SOE and  LucasArts... who both seem to think they can use this game to completely rewrite all of Star Wars history.

This pack opens doors a bit wider in the series and makes the game more fun to play. But, it's quite not enough to only have 3 professions to choose from. From what I see that this is the only down fall. However, the flipside is that if your sims are in one of these professions, the pathway to stardome is extremly challenging which makes it much fun and strategic. (At the time of this review,) I haven't really gotten into the guts of the professions, however again the big annoyance is constant posting to Facebook and the Sims 3 Forum. (In my opinion only) this feature should have never been added. But since it was, I'm glad you can turn it off if you don't plan moving your characters around.

I really don't care for this perk because every time you start a new sim, you end up cluttering your board with new shots that will be deleted. Now sending you sim to a friends game is a awsome idea! I haven't tried that part yet because my sims haven't gotten that far in the careers plus I don't know anyone on the forms well enough to post my sims.

So why buy the Expansion pack? Like all the previous games in the this series each builds on the others and add new features and enhancements. Some of them are awsome and some are annoying but either way you look at it the end series makes each expansion and stuff pack worth it for the complete series.

It is the slowest first person shooter online of any game I've played. And I've played a ton of them. I had a straight ethernet hookup to my campus's network. My average bandwidth was about 2.7 Meg/sec. That's about 20 times the average bandwidth of DSL (I'm talking average, not peak). I have a 2.4 Gig processor with 512 meg ram and a radeon 9600 video card. I was STILL having lag. It was almost comical it was so bad sometimes. If I was hosting, I would find that the poor people who had DSL or, heaven forbid, dial-up would be shooting in a totally different direction than where I was because the network didn't update our positions quickly enough. Anyone who has this game knows what I'm talking about.
The real travesty of this game is that the multiplayer maps are INCREDIBLE. They are 10 times better than Halo for Xbox, which is why this game is so frustrating: you have no chance to fully enjoy playing your friends because the whole multiplayer experience is just one big lagfest. To get a better idea of how unpopular this has become, go to bungie.net and click on their link to Halo for PC. Take a quick gander at how many people are playing at any given time. I just checked and it was 2455. This is worldwide, mind you. Doesn't that seem rather low? Even now, over 10 times that many people are playing Starcraft, a dinosaur compared to Halo.

And if it weren't for this major downfall, this mindless hack and slash game would actually be a blast to play.

The best part is that you play as a team of four, each with a different special elemental ability. For example, the scientist uses lightning, the Indian uses the wind, the pirate uses fire, and the girl uses...well, guns. By pressing the D pad you can cycle through your team in quick succession. (Sadly, it's only single player; no co-op). The team as a whole shares an energy meter, so one character's Special move depletes every one else's, which makes for some skillful gameplay. The other unique, albeit kind of useless, innovation is the need to ""get along"" with each other. Each character has sort of friendship HP system that can be raised by performing tag team combos. The more friendly you are, the stronger your attacks. In true RPG fashion, all members can level up by defeating more monsters.

Which brings me back to my opening paragraph. The game throws so many monsters at you, it's takes forever to get through a level. Sometimes you're required to backtrack to find items, again slashing through endless foes. And not different foes mind you, the same foe every time, at least until you defeat that particular enemy's boss. So what you get is two hours of fighting the Wolfman over and over and over.

This game is nothing like the movie, and in my opinion was a very over-hyped game.  ""Why?""
1. The gameplay: It's just boring.  You start off spending an hour in the Shire, trying to do various tasks, which are rewarded very lightly.  For example, you have to give the lady who's buying your house a letter, which takes 15 minutes to find (usually more).  There is no map of the Shire, no hints of what to do.  Everything has to be figured out by yourself.  So after you find the little paper or letter, you walk back to give it to her.  But nooooooooo wait, you have to find another item without any help and ring a bell because she believe there are ""Wolves"" in the shire.  That's another 15 minutes if your lucky, 30-45 minutes if your not.  You also have to complete  close to a dozen tasks to get your ""Corruption"" rating up.  If you become to corrupted (it's a second bar above your health), you just die.  I had to start over several times because of that.  So say that somehow you do get all this done, get stocked with supplies, talk to everyone, and are ready to go in less than 2 hours, you must escape the black riders.  I did this, and it is extremely difficult, and yet in parts so easy it's stupid.  There is always a certain area you can go where the black riders can't get u.  And yet at the end, u must make a run for it.  No where to go, no where to hide.  And the black rider you must at the end escape from, is on a horse.  Well, if you get past all that in 3 hours, without dieing, your lucky.  Most people don't.  And the whole process is just boring.  No excitement, no real rewards.  I hated the first part.
Well, once your out of the Shire, you head into a forest.  The forest is full of creatures, which are all so easy to kill.  You must find your 3 companions who came with u, who somehow git lost in 4 different parts of the forest.  This alone took another hour, and if your not lucky, you'll get lost forever (literally).  Once past that, you are caught by a willow tree, when u are suddenly saved by a fat, short man named ""Tom Bambaldi"" or something like that.  You must then find 15 lilies, which takes another 30 minutes.  At this point, I had died 5 times, had not found anything I liked, was bored, and was just sick of the repetitiveness of the game.  That was my wonderful experience playing this game (luckily I rented, and returned the next day).
Graphics: This would get probably 4 stars.  The graphics are pretty goood, but are PS2 graphics.  It wasn't what it could have been.  For example: The black riders are in total 3D, and look really cool.  But their capes for some reason are flat and are in 2D.  Very dumb.  You can't go in the water, which once again, looks very bad.  The leaves you can quote ""Run through"" you can only run through once.  And they are very are, only a few for each part of the level.  But in many aspects, the game was good.  You can break many things, and that's always fun as they fully destruct.  The Shire is brought to life well, and in many ways, this game was fun to look at.  But with the horrible gameplay, this game could not be saved.
3. Sound / Lasting Appeal: Well, the voice acting was fantastic, and the one point where this game was 5 stars.  It was always fun to listen to people talk, and the cut scenes are very well done.  Unfortunantly, this was the only fun part of the game.  As for the lasting appeal, none.  It takes 5 hours just to get a chapter into the story, and the whole thing, I'm afraid, just bored me.
If you think you can stand all this, then this is the game for u.  Persounally, I think a game should start out easy and become challenging later on, and let u do something cool and interesting within the first hour.  Some may like this game, but I sure didn't.  Over-hyped, and over-bought, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring for the XBOX and PS2 was a disapointment in my mind.
Oh, the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is coming to the XBOX on January 1st.  I'd go for that, as it's by EA Sports, has a lot more action, and you play through both movies; The Fellowship and the Two Towers.  Thx!",This game was at best...decent.,1039219200,3,,

While the long-running series has had plenty of awesome releases, entertaining we mystery fans for years, there have been some weak entries in the mystery series (""Creature of Kapu Cave,"" ""Ransom of the Seven Ships,"" to name a couple) and this one sadly is among them.

The main problem, as most point out, is the lack of a real mystery. There isn't even an introduction other than the game-show host introducing the show. I don't know why Nancy was there, and I don't know what the mystery really was. The game show isn't even set up very well. It feels deserted, there are no instructions. It's not programmed very well, either. Characters will sometimes reference or talk about things that Nancy hasn't even seen yet. At one point, the video confession 9 for a character came available with confession 8 not even having been posted yet.

The storyline with Sonny isn't that interesting. There's nothing to research, no one to really call (except Jamilla, a character from the Egypt game) and barely anyone to speak with. You've got a couple of contestants, but they're never actually participating. They're just standing around camp. I honestly don't know what the point of having George around was, much less Bess, who does even more standing around than the other contestants.

The first play-through was alright until you realize how repetitive it was. There's also a problem with the difficulty scaling I think. On the first play-through the game was almost too easy and then on the next difficulty the game is way too hard. I think part of that has to do with how terrible the loot is. 95% of the loot you find is worse than the same equipment you found ages ago and 99% of the loot is for a different class then you're playing. I beat Diablo 3 Inferno difficulty and the loot I got after the Diablo boss fight was a joke. I think there was one item for my current class and it's stats were way under what I already had from the beginning of the game.

During the beta, the game really had nothing going on.  I told myself it was for the simple fact that I was playing the beta.  Well, I seem to have been wrong.

First some good things.  This is the best looking game I have ever seen.  It is amazing to watch.  Not just the cut scenes, everything is incredible.  The voice work, at least so far, seems really well done.  Everything controls well and feels great when playing.  It all runs very smoothly.  It is easy to figure out and learn everything you need to know.  Your character builds up their stats.  You can get more weapons, armor and other things, the stronger you get.  So, you have something to work towards.

Now for some bad stuff.
This game seems to have absolutely nothing happening.  I mean, you go through the places and see characters, buildings and other things.  But, they seem to be there just to be there.  It reminded me of an MMORPG that was about to close its servers, one that had been around for a decade.  It was just a baron wasteland.  I felt kind of lonely.  Haha  I did see some other players running around, maybe five or so.  But, I am wondering what the point of all this is?  To have such a great game that has nothing going on is a shame.

On top of that, the enemy seems to be in a group, stuck with a tether, just standing there.  They do shoot at you.  But, they hardly ever come after you, or move at all.  You just run around alone, get some info, go to a place, shoot some bad guys, get back and do it all over again.  I just don't see how this is going to remain entertaining to me or anyone for a long period of time.  It reminds me of when I am playing a fps and I create a room for online play.  Well, I am just running around doing nothing until other players join.  That is exactly what this game feels like.

Right now, this is one of the few games I've purchased that I wish I had waited a while for.  BUT, when I woke up this morning, the first thing I thought of was this game.  I think it has to do with the building your character up.  I have other things to do today.  So I will not be playing this game.  But I am thinking about it.  I guess, it is just for the fact that I've been hearing so much about this game.  It just seems completely unfinished and empty.  I really cannot sell it now.  I've used the codes to get the stuff you get with this version.  Oh well, only time will let me know if this game ends up being worth the $99.99 price tag.  Right now, I would lean towards no.

Update.
Ok, after playing this game for a while, I changed my review from a 3 out of 5 to a 2 out of 5.  The game just is not that fun.  It is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played.  You get a mission, go to the location, run around a completely empty location, get to a pint with a group of enemies that are all in one big clump, kill them, though, if they have a large number come at you at once, you die, when you kill them you go do something and complete the mission.

Every enemy, thus far, looks the same.  They have three or four main enemies.  Then they have the ones that float around.  It reminds me of two things.  An arcade game and a launch game.  After everything I had heard of this game, it was all bogus.  Such a boring game.  No real story or anything worth playing.  A complete waste of $99.99.

I tried playing the one part in which you play against people.  I can never find anyone on there and I just sit and sit while waiting.  I just quit and play the regular game.  Also, I never really see other people playing.  I just run around nothing.

Update 2:
Ok, there is something interesting about this game from IGN.  It is kind of giving a reason that this game was so stripped down, has nothing going on and seems as if it is not complete.

2.0,False,"04 27, 2004",A3DLZ57U7AT6EJ,B00005Y0IW,Andrew G,"So, we were first told about Counter-Strike: Condition Zero back in 2000, when Counter-Strike was still a GOOD multiplayer gamer, not ridden with as many hackers, and definitely not flooded with annoying high-pitched kids telling eachother off through the voice chat feature.
As you would expect from my anger witnessed in the above paragraph, I stopped playing the game. I waited and waited to get CS:CZ, the messiah of the Counter-Strike title. So, it just so happens that the game gets pushed back a few months, and then to the next year, and then the year after that. After a while, I lost interest in the game and just assumed it would never come out; I was wrong.
So, out of no where, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero appears on the shelves of game stores everywhere -- and at a pretty unbelievable price! What's there to lose? I picked up a copy and ran home with it -- ditched my important work I had to finish at home and saved it for later, now it is Counter-Strike time! I load it up and what do I get? Well, first, for all you Linux users, it was VERY hard to get emulating correctly on WineX. If you are a Linux user and a member of the WineX community, look at the message boards because there are now posts on how to get the game running correctly. So, once I get my emulation problems out of the way, I was up and running with my game. Impressed? No, I wasn't even close to impressed. Graphics haven't improved even close to what I would have expected them to in this day and age. New content? A little: You get a few different weapons, some fixed bugs, a few new multiplayer maps, and a single player addition to the game. So, on with the single player:
It's awful. And unlike many games such as Unreal Tournament 2003, graphics were NOT saving this gameplay fault. It's not very easy to explain really, but all you do is play the role of a counter-terrorist leader trying to take down a terrorist organization from committing random acts of crime. No depth to this story here, this is no Max Payne. Overall, the single player is not a great addition to this dying mutliplayer title.
Could anything, oh ANYTHING save this game from getting one star? Something sure did save it! Multiplayer, something I haven't got into yet, is a bit out of the ordinary for Counter-Strike players. First, it DOES NOT use that AWFUL 'steam' program to connect to servers. Thank god. Second, it has implemented a nice little feature that STOPS HACKING ALMOST COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT!! Thank you for this, because the cheaters on Counter-Strike ruined the game for everyone, and this is the one feature of the game that I thought was worth the four-year wait. However, not much has changed at all as far as GAMEPLAY goes in the multiplayer version of this game; still your plain ol' terrorist vs. counter-terrorist game trying to defuse the bomb or rescure the hostages or whatever. And a note: if you hate Counter-Strike like I do for the same REASONS that I do (the ANNOYING, and IMMATURE players, especially all the little children with terrible net-ediquet), you will NOT be satisfied in this game. Why? Oh, simply because there's MORE of them in the Condition Zero game over the original game. Don't blow your money on this game as an excuse to leave the terrible playing environments found in the original, because this is no sollution in Condition Zero.
So, this game isn't technically advanced (in the areas of video OR audio), this game isn't offering a very stellar single player game, and the multiplayer game can be found with the FREE version of Counter-Strike minus a little of the non-friendly environments. What good is this game? Beats me.  Overall, this game would have earned maybe three stars or MAYBE even four stars had it come out on time. But honestly, we DID NOT wait four years to get a game of such low quality.
Don't waste your money on this game. There's better games to be bought for this price range. You can try Max Payne 2, a great single player game. Or you can try out the warcraft series, a game I LOVE in the multiplayer scene. For a little bit more money, Unreal Tournament 2004 is possibly one of the best multi AND single player games I have EVER played in my LIFE. These are better options that will keep you occupied when you're bored and feel the need to play a video game.

Actually these are the worst graphics I've seen on any PS2 game. Imagine grainy and then viewed behnd a net curtain. Quite awful really. The voices of the characters are terrible too, especially Prince Charming. No where near as authentic and funny as the other PS2 Shrek games. In the video action the characters don't look 'right' either.

The games are twists on fairground stalls but are very basic eg press X to let go of your flying frog to throw in the bucket or press L1 and R1 repeatedly for the donkey race.

Some of the stalls are fun. Mudsliding, pumpkin throwing, gingy running on a conveyor belt and childs trike racing are good ideas but poorly done. Nothing is what I would call good as it is badly let down by the graphics. Running around a windmill is horrendous as you lose sight of your runner.

I was hoping these games would be up to the standard of the excellent mini games on the end of 'Shrek The Third' but they are not half as much fun and visually dreadful to look at.

There are 5 different locations (just menu screens): Gingyland, 3 Blind Mice Midway, Fiona's Funhouse, The Poison Apple and Pinocchio Park.
You can chose to play these games as a quick game randomly or enter story mode which is just playing one game after another with some horrendous graphics in between. There is also tournament mode where 5 mini games are picked at random for you to compete in.

You can unlock more games (there are 28 in total) and bonus items like videos and concepts.

My 4 year old will play this for 5 minutes or so before getting bored. He can easily compete in the games and it does teach basic button pressing. He can win most of the games immediately which shows its very basic level (he only turned 4 this month).

Overall I am tempted to give this 1 star but for a 3/4 year old it probably scrapes a 2 star.

Buy 'Shrek the Third' as it is much superior to this if you want a good Shrek Game with Mini Games. Buy 'Smash and Crash' racing if you want a game with a great tournament 2 player option.

Instead, in this game, there are about nine moves, most of them useless because they do so little damage. This alone makes this game so incredibly boring after two hours that I have to wonder what the creators were thinking when they made this game. Even multiplayer mode loses its appeal pretty quickly, because of the limited amount of moves. There are also a few too many items, and it really makes it less fair that you can use a big baseball bat or a lightsaber or a beamgun to help you win. Also, considering that the gameplay wasn't good enough, the fighting environment takes a new approach at trying to add lots of detail and affecting play, but most of the battle grounds are far too plain for what it is trying to attempt. But I will say that the game has incredible graphics, each character and scene developed beautifully.

You can make the characters go at normal speed, or one-fourth of it, making for a great amount of Matrix-like suspense.

At this point I started a new town. The next two months I adhered to the strict pathway system to preserve the grass.  In the end, I have to make a choice.  Do I want to play Animal Crossing and enjoy everything it has to offer or do I want to have grass? The simple truth is, I can't do both and that stinks.

Little did I know.  While this version brings over the real-time holidays from the GameCube version as well as a few of the awesome features that were added to Wild World (Flea Market Day, etc.), and tops it off with some very unique additions (like the city and expanded museum), it didn't port over one of the most popular features of Wild World which was being able to earn pictures of villagers by building friendships, nor did villagers' individual hobbies make the migration.

When we first started playing, we old timers had no clue just how devastating this single feature would be to our games.  Many of us purchased City Folk late last fall or early winter and within weeks our towns were barren of snow.  With no snow it was impossible to build snowmen and collect the snowman furniture series.  No snow means that when things green up, you no longer have grass.

As far as no grass goes, some would deem that mainly as an aesthetics issue but it goes beyond looks.  There are bugs during the summer months that are only found on grassy areas.

The path feature was originally designed to make cute little paths from place to place in our towns.  Unfortunately, what even the creators didn't seem to realize is that in playing an Animal Crossing game, nearly every single tile of the town becomes a pathway as the player traverses the map on their various chores, games with villagers, and special holiday events.  Doing chores like collecting fossils and harvesting fruit should be done on a daily basis. Neighbors frequently ask players to run errands and play games like Hide and Seek with them.  Each of these activities involves walking across your town. Holidays come only every few months, but most of them are during months with the worst decay rate and involve much, much running through your town to collect all the pieces of each holiday furniture series.

I know practically by heart the advice Nintendo gives players who are suffering grass deprivation in their towns and I also know first-hand it doesn't work. They advise planting trees and flowers to speed up grass growth.  Grass growth is only expedited in the exact tile where a tree stands.  While grass does grow faster under flowers, those flowers must be watered to be kept alive and unless they are directly against a path where they can be reached for watering, the grass underneath them must be walked on to do the watering, resulting in more grass loss.

One of the features heavily promoted in AC:CF is the wi-fi feature, whereby people are able to visit other's towns, which lets people play together staying in touch with friends and family.  Yet while this is a key selling point, Nintendo is telling players who complain about their disappearing grass to quit using the wi-fi feature.  The result is that while not having visitors in your town will reduce grass wear, the player might as well forget ever opening their town gate again because once they start reallowing visitors, the grass will just wear away again. Or as I have experienced, visitors come to your town and they are afraid to do anything for fear of killing your grass.

At the heart of the matter, what we have here is a game that can be dealt with in two ways.  One way is to play it as one would any Animal Crossing game, doing daily tasks at whim and leisure, all the while destroying grass.  Or we can put in a system of pathways and walk only on those paths to keep grass from being destroyed and thereby effectively never experiencing roughly seventy-five percent of the gameplay.",Not My Idea of a Real Good Time,1238457600,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

With the smash success of classics like Guitar Hero III: Legends Of Rock, and the amazing gameplay of Rock Band, which takes great classics like Bon Jovi's Wanted Dead Or Alive, into the beat of your own guitar rifts, it is hard to find a game that can be beat. But, that sadly, hasn't been shown as well with Dance Dance Revolution, the orignal music dance game. While it has faired well, it just hasn't been able to really keep up the pace of gameplay. Now, a new spin will try to make Dance Dance Revolution more appealing to a younger audience, but is it just a rhythm or 2 left feet?

Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Channel Edition for the Playstation 2, takes the DDR gamble, and brings in the appeal to a younger audience by using songs from Disney Channel staples you can dance your way to. You get songs from hits like Hannah Montana, Kim Possible, That's So Raven, and their made for TV movies like The Cheetah Girls and especially High School Musical. The graphics fair well, as you step each and every way to the beat of the songs, but the gameplay misses out for die hard older fanatics of the game franchise. The feeling of the game feels a bit old, and doesn't measure to choosing songs from classics like Cars or other movies.

All in all, Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Channel Edition is good for young fans of these Disney Channel shows, and those who think Miley Cyrus is hot, but misses the rhythm of the dance floor for veterans. I think it is time for die hard fans of DDR to find something better to play with music too. Perhaps Guitar Hero would be a better buy for the Playstation 2.

2.0,False,"06 18, 2017",AP3V0ZR3XLVQX,B00UO4NKA4,Ton Yanzik,"I've never played many MMOs in my life, despite always loving the idea of them. The monthly paywall was an obstacle I've never quite been willing enough to climb, only ever having done so with the paid version of Runescape for a few years just over a decade ago, loving many aspects of the experience. As such, I have little experience with MMOs, but possess an old, rotten lust to be a member of one. And while FFXIV most certainly didn't convince me it was 'the one,' mostly due to horrible press at its initial launch and it being a Final Fantasy game, I was ultimately pushed into it.

FFXIV actually allows for quite a bit of testing before anyone commits to that ~$12+ a month. At least at the moment, there's a free trial that ends at level 30 (which takes quite a while to get to if you're new), only really excluding you from the social aspects of the game, such as free companies (guilds), having friends, and the market boards. Anyone at all interested would get a good feel for the game and all it has to offer in this free trial, and I recommend it heavily to those that are. And even if you do buy the game, the first month is free, allowing you to experience every feature without having to pay the monthly fee yet. Whether or not this is an industry standard, these are nice features for potential buyers, and being that there's nothing major hidden in these trials, having seen so after playing the full version for a month and a half, it gives a realistic impression of what to expect.

Trying it out for yourself aside, is it actually worth it? To me, only mildly so. Initially, I almost didn't get to play the game at all due to getting installation errors. After about a dozen tries over the course of a few days, it finally took. With some searching, I found this is common both for new players installing the first time and old players installing patches and expansions. Of all people experiencing them, not one had any real solutions, and I've read many stories of people quitting the game due to never being able to download updates to it. It seems I was one of the lucky ones that eventually got it to work, and I haven't experienced any since. Once I finally did get into the game and began creating my character, I found many features were meaningless. From your race, ""nameday,"" and guardian, nothing actually means anything in game. It's the equivalent of being a self-proclaimed worshiper of Zamorak in Runescape without any of the awesomeness that came with that. As far as options go, they seem about standard, but don't allow for much creativity. Basically, do you want to be blue or white? Tall or short? A midget or average? Those that really get into roleplaying their characters would likely be disappointed, as I found nothing to work with myself. Fortunately, I play games like this primarily for fun and various types of grinding, so that's what I've focused on thus far.

By far, the worst part of the game is the main story. It's typical, to say the least, of a Final Fantasy game. You're a nobody that quickly gets involved in the major happenings of the events around you, of which, none are particularly interesting. There's an evil empire that's evil because it's evil, and wants to destroy everyone else or something. So, all the smaller factions need to band together, with none other than the infamous Cid and a rumored airship. And, of course, there are crystals everywhere. And I mean everywhere. The landscapes, the enemies, even in your characters hallucinations. If you're not a fan of FF games, you'll find absolutely nothing here other than being thankful you can skip all the cutscenes just to get through it for more exp, dungeons, and items. This is especially apparent after the main part of the main story ends, and the filler content Square Enix added right before the first expansion kicks in. This is where the only benefits of grinding the story completely vanish. At level 50, the level you'd now be at, you'll quickly find that the only way of getting good experience is to do daily roulettes and to grind the Palace of the Dead, with quest experience now barely moving your experience bar at all. And while the main story was your sole way of getting worthwhile gear until this point (unless you wanted to spend vast amounts of gil on things you'd outgrow in a weeks time from the market board), poetics (a late game currency) are what gets you your awesome level 50 gear, found in a shop in a late game town. In addition, all gathering, and possibly crafting classes immediately hit a level wall, no longer leveling at a reasonable rate. And thus, begins the long, tedious, forced grinding of 100 quests to get to the first expansion, a necessity to pump any more life into the game.

If there's anything to be enjoyed here, it's the gameplay. Generally speaking, it's fun. There are a plethora of classes and jobs to be had, from your main damage dealing ones to gathering and crafting ones. With as many skills and options as there are, it can take some time to get used to, but once you get some patterns down, it's easy enough to master. Despite how flashy and chaotic the game seemed to me at first, it's actually very repetitive once you do reach that point. I'd go so far as to say many of the gameplay elements are akin to social network games, as ones like fishing and mining take less planning and effort than they do. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially for those that like grinding like myself, but most things in the game are far from exhilarating. It most certainly doesn't help that everything feels like it's being played on easy mode, as there's really no repercussions for anything. You don't lose anything but a bit of time for dying, and PVP of any sort is non-existent outside of the arena. The biggest challenge is trying to complete dungeons and roulettes with incompetent or new players, since it's essentially impossible to fail, even due to the time limit being reached, which is usually well over an hour long. In the solo areas, the biggest challenge you'll face is keeping enemies that can't come close to defeating you away as you try to travel or collect resources, as it's nothing more than an annoyance. The only things truly challenging or difficult in this game are the marketplace/economy, where it's extremely difficult to sell things or do well in since players bring down prices to basically being free on a daily basis, and getting through required quests to be able to have access to more areas, dungeons, and features.

Overall, FFXIV is just a below average game. It's not actively bad, but offers little in terms of gameplay and making anything of yourself within it, with the story and quests being an active detriment. With enough time, anyone could stumble through anything, offering the appropriate underwhelming rewards of having done so. In addition, after a while, the overwhelmingly linear nature of the game really begins to show and cripples and destroys any illusion of a living or vast world. For under $10 a month, I can see this game being worth it for people that find anything at all enjoyable in it. Dungeons are kind of fun, and so is gathering, and trials and the Palace of the Dead are even more so. But at a minimum of $12 a month if you buy several months in advance, I'd have to advise finding a different MMO.

What I feel is great about this pad is everything except the cordless facet of it.  There are no hard edges or loose feel to any of the parts.  There is nice, solid feel and feedback to the D-Pad (I prefer the solid concave disc, less fatigue).  The dual joysticks are also concave which is nice on the thumbs.  They also move and feel just like the sticks on the DualShock PS1/PS2 gamepad which is good.  The buttons on the Cordless RumblePad are solid and have a good action to them.  There are no harsh edges to dig into your skin.  There are no loose, hard-plastic reactions or noises to these buttons.  And the hand extensions are perfect for my hands.  Once again there are no harsh edges and everything is contoured to fit comfortably.  The rumble effect is just like the DualShock as well.  It's neat and sometimes helpful, but really isn't necessary.  Fortunately, Logitech allows you to control whether the Rumble effect is on or off (major battery conservation in having it off).

Gamepads are a seasonal item.  They're only good for certain games.  Often they are necessary for ported Console games.  Which brings me to my present.

After a week of web research I have discovered the my receiver is dead.  And that this has happened to numerous WingMan Cordless RumblePad owners who have had their gamepad for a year or more.
There are no replacement receivers sold.  The best advice offered is to ""try"" Logitech Tech Support. :(
With a decent set of rechargeable batteries (total of 4 AA, 8 if you want to hot-swap them) and a good rechargeable battery recharger that drains all the power from the batteries before it recharges them, you will have the best wireless rumblepad for a year.  And then after that year you may find yourself with a dead receiver.  And after it becomes a lost cause through normal avenues, you may find yourself wanting to open that receiver to see if you can find the short or whatever is causing the problem.  You'll find the screw in the bottom holding things together isn't alone and that the seam on the receiver is sealed with some kind of ACME Super Glue and give up.
Wish me luck.  I'm off to find a replacement gamepad.

I strongly recommend both of those games over Forza 5.  They have really taken the ""Candy Crush"" approach of gently and sometimes not-so-gently encouraging spending of actual cash.  Unlocking everything in the game could easily cost you $70, but that only unlocks the option to buy items that still require in game currency to use.  The in game currency accumulates so slowly that you'll have to repeat the same races so many times you'll lose all interest in the game before getting to unlock and use the cars you spent additional real money on.

In summary, the game is thin on content and it requires mindless repetition of races and tracks in order to grind out enough in game credits to unlock what little extra content there is.  And the cool cars require in game DLC that costs more than the game itself.

2.0,False,"07 8, 2011",A36UKFV79879MD,B00002STFD,BX Lounger,"Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire was released near the end of 1996 and was one of the first generation games for the N64. It's a decent Star Wars game overall with nagging issues that keep it from being one of the better games for the system.

Set after the events in the movie Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back but before the events in the movie Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (and also based on the book of the same name), you set out to help Luke Skywalker and rescue Princess Leia from the hands of Prince Xizor. Choose from 3 difficulty levels and battle through 9 levels set in planets that are part of the Star Wars universe; battling enemies and making your way around as you would in a platform game.

The PROS: Well, the overall presentation is good enough to make you feel you're in the Star Wars universe as the sound effects and music are what you expect to hear in Star Wars games. Even though the game has 9 levels, they are long levels so you won't be cruising through so easily.

The CONS: Unfortunately, this is not one of the better SW games available for the N64 for several reasons. This game was part of the first generation of games for the N64 and it shows. The graphics did not age so well and back in 1996 , they were horrible. Super Mario 64 was a launch title and it had way better graphics. Here, the game gets choppy when there's a lot of action, the frame rate dips every so often and there is lots of ""pop up"" scenery and dense fog (to cover up areas that don't have any animation.) The controls are no better than the ones in the PS title ""Tomb Raider"". Your character controls like a robot, aiming is a chore to do and the game has horrible collision detection. Add in the platform elements where you have to jump in certain areas and either you end up dying or trying to jump again because the jump button doesn't respond until a full second AFTER you press it. On top of all that, the game's difficulty is pretty unforgiving. Even if you set in on ""easy"", the enemies are still pretty tough and sometimes you have no idea if your weapons have an effect on whoever you are shooting at.

Considering that the first level is easily the best of the game altogether, you're pretty much hyped and can't wait to see the rest of the game. Unfortunately, when you do, you realize that the game falls flat on its face. Star Wars: SotE had a lot of potential. It's a Star Wars game and gives you the feeling that you're part of the awesome story it conveys. But that feeling goes away fast as the crappy graphics, robot like controls, bad platform elements and near impossible difficulty that this game presents keeps it from being the kind of game it could have been. Only the die hard Star Wars fans would pick this up. For everyone else, be warned as other Star Wars games released for the N64 are much, much better than this somewhat playable effort.",Star Wars game with major issues,1310083200,2,,

You also lose the ""souls"" you have gained and the healing potions (leaves) you had.  The height of frustration for me came when I reached the first boss.  This guy is real hard.  Like before, if you die you don't get back the healing leaves you use.  So with each defeat you get weaker and weaker.  Soon you will run out of leaves and have nothing to buy more of them with.

To me this game wasn't fun at all. The movements are slow and awkward; There are times when you are being attacked and you can't even tell where it's coming from, mostly due to clumsy, plodding controls that don't allow you to react as quickly as you would like. The graphics to me were far from 'next gen'; While very creative in theory, the graphics are often muddy and not very well defined(esp. when compared to a game like 'Drake's Fortune' or even 'Far Cry', which both had great jungle look to them...).  The creatures are cool, but you are often outnumbered...and with the sub par controls, you're usually dead meat. I have been playing FPS's for a long time, and while I'm not the best, I'm def not a novice. I know when I died because of my idiocy and when I died because of a control issue. This doesn't even control as well as games from 4 or 5 years ago, like 'DOOM 3', 'Return to Castle Wolfenstein; Tides of War', and 'Killzone'. I guess I just found this really boring and not up to snuff. I didn't really care about the story, and the action was more annoying than fun.

But why do you have to kill children in one of the early levels? Isn't that a little perverse? People will like this game, no doubt, but be aware it's an adult game, and parts can be hard to stomach. YMMV.

--Edit--

I couldn't manage to sell this game, in mint condition, unregistered, on Amazon.com for a cut-rate price. That ought to tell you what people think of Prey these days. I went ahead and finished it, and - wow, just wow, this is almost certainly the worst game I've ever played. As the hours plodded on, I kept looking around for a fork to plunge into my neck.

The later levels present one uninspiring challenge after another. As the game progresses, it somehow becomes even less dynamic than it was in the beginning. The Unreal engine really shows its age here, with extremely limited movement or precision, but that doesn't matter, because the entire game is on rails anyway.

Each major fight is won by strafing and blasting - YAWN - and as the monsters get more and more advanced, their behavior is less and less interesting. Some present no feedback whatsoever, they just play out their scripts until you blast 'em dead. Nothing is at all challenging about the ending levels - in one boss fight, after discovering that movement wasn't any help, I won by standing still and spamming the mouse button while reading the Drudge Report on another machine - but the truth is, a challenge wouldn't matter anyway, because the death & rebirth sequences seem to have no effect on your success or failure at all. The only way to lose is to literally get bored and quit.

The glowy ""pixel light"" graphics are a high point, and are used to good effect in many places, such as the lightning gun, the spirit tunnel and the gravity portals. But even that one-trick isn't enough to save this pony, as the effect is so overused as to make gameplay impossible: blasts of enemy ""pixel light"" fire, so indistinct from their surrounding that they're invisible, seem to randomly assault the player in some encounters, including the utterly contrived final boss fight. It's a waste of a good technology.

I never got to play multiplayer, because the few servers still up are always completely empty. That should tell you something.

2.0,False,"08 13, 2014",A1RNKZK9Q8R8GP,B002BSC54I,Narniak,"I have played and enjoyed all the Legend of Zelda 3D games for the past 15+ years, from OOT, to MM, to WW, to TP.  Skyward Sword is without a doubt the biggest disappointment in this tired franchise history.  If Nintendo plans for the Wii U to survive this new console generation, they need to stop rehashing their same old Zelda and Mario kiddy content over and over again.  They need to wake up and take some hints from far superior adult RPGs like The Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect and even Assassin's Creed.  Skyward Sword is the product of Nintendo's blatant laziness and lack of respect for long time Zelda fans.

OOOOOH NOOOOO!!  You Nintendo fan boys protest that most of the mainstream sheeple Demon Pig media sites all gave Skyward Sword high marks??  $$ INSERT DOLLARS HERE $$  Unfortunately, much like TV, movies, and music nowadays, critical acclaim means absolutely nothing as far as something actually being good.

Where to start with this utter trash??

Graphics are a complete joke for a game released in 2011.  They somehow managed to take the cartoon look of WW and combine it with the washed-out pastel color palate of TP to create something truly uninspired and awful.  These graphics are laughably bad.  They seriously look like 2001 at best.  The cartoon look of WW was annoying, but at least is was sharp and vivid.  The washed-out look of TP was annoying, but at least it felt somewhat grown-up.  Skyward Sword looks horrible.

Sound is as usual completely void of voice-acting.  Again, this is inexcusable for a game released in 2011.  I understand you don't need to make Link talk, but for God's sake why can't the NPCs actually communicate and act like living beings??  It completely takes you out of the experience and makes you feel like you're playing a kiddy game.  The musical score is overall decent, but nothing nearly as memorable as OOT or WW.  The harp is utterly stupid and pointless, and the very few times you actually need to strum it properly are an exercise in frustration.

The Wii motion+ controls are implemented OK for most of the game, in fact I often quite enjoyed slashing away at different enemies in the precise direction needed.  However, the motion control limitations rear their ugly head at the worst opportune times, which are the boss battles.  Need to switch between your sword and secondary weapon quickly?  Good luck trying to select and recenter your secondary weapon on the fly!

Roughly 75% of the gameplay is nothing more than a boring chore to open the next map area, obtain the next item, complete the next fetch quest, gather stupid treasures to upgrade items, or gather stupid bugs to upgrade potions.  There is no real overworld to speak of, only Skyloft, a forest area, a volcano area, and a desert area.  You keep revisiting these same areas over and over and over again to simply open up another small portion or twist within.  Completely linear gameplay with virtually ZERO exploration whatsoever.  Just think of the beautiful overworld of Oblivion or Skyrim and then laugh at this utter garbage!

Anything that is actually a treasure such as a Goddess Cube reward like a piece of heart is immediately shown on your map, as are almost every single solitary objective in the game.  If it's not revealed on your map, fear not, because your constant annoying sidekick Fi will make sure she reminds you exactly what to do and where you are supposed to go.  Well, there will be at least an 85% chance!  This kiddy game is apparently geared towards 7 year olds, because that is how it treats you the entire way.  Puzzles are a joke, and dungeon design although innovative in the tradition of Zelda, is severely hindered by all the hand-holding G-rated nonsense.

On the other hand, Nintendo inexplicably decided to make a couple of the half dozen or so mini-games so insanely difficult to beat that you will need to spend many hours of frustration getting those last few pieces of heart (unless you get very lucky).  In particular, the Boss Rush lightning round requires you to repeat not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, but 8 of the bosses you have already defeated consecutively, and without being able to use heart potions or bottled fairies.  Even when using the Guardian Potion+ trick this mini-game is nearly impossible unless you get VERY LUCKY with the specific order that the Thunder Dragon decides the boss battles for you (in other words, the 2 or 3 battles that actually give you hearts).  You will NOT be able to get Link's classic Hylian Shield unless you submit to this redundant root canal exercise, leaving the game feeling empty and incomplete.

And speaking of boss battles, Skyward Sword falls well short of Zelda standards in this respect as well.  Of the 16 or so boss battles in the game, almost half of them are literally REPEATS of the same freaking boss!  Thanks Nintendo, I so wanted to fight a giant black worm not once, not twice, but thrice, and then more times in the mini-game!  Thanks again Nintendo, I so wanted to fight the homosexual ninja not once, not twice, but thrice, and then more times in the mini-game!

The story is somewhat different and compelling, but everything else in the game is so dull, repetitive and lifeless that I found myself barely even caring about Zelda or the fate of the world for that matter.  I am currently at the last dungeon in the game, but can barely muster the energy to finish Skyward Sword simply because is has not been a fun experience.  My only hope is that this game somehow musters an epic final boss battle the likes of TP, which truly saved that flawed game in the end.  From what I have read online that wish will most likely not come true.

Homefront starts out with a fantastic, and interesting premise.  The 15 or so years in the future the United States has been invaded by North Korea.  It really hits home too, because in the story (again in the opening scene, no spoilers here past the first five minutes) Kim Jung Il dies and his son takes power.  Which just happened in real life.  So it has a very entertaining premise, which is why I bought the game.  Unfortunately that's the high point of this game.

The campaign is well written, but poorly executed.  The main reason this game isn't fun is because they ramped up the difficulty to cover the fact that the game is VERY short.  So rather than create a normal length game, they just made you into the wimpiest feeling soldier around.  Couple that with fairly obscene reload times (30 seconds or so) and it left me very frustrated.  Further couple that with every enemy in the game wanting to shoot me and ignore the tanks, armor, and other 15 soldiers I'm with, and it's unreal.

In one section I had to climb onto a shipping container (that's where the game instructed me to go) and take out a guy with an RPG.  The second the guy would come into view he would immediately launch an RPG directly at me and I would die.  I did that part 15 times.  Finally, the guy somehow was magically killed by someone else, or I probably would have done it another 15 times before blind lobbing grenades to take him out.  In another section, I was walking over a bridge and I'm with tanks and dozens of other soldiers, and the enemy far off in the distance isn't aiming at the tanks with his RPGs, he's aiming at little old me.  What?!?

Positives:

Great story
Great mechanics
Guns feel awesome

Negatives:

Far too easy to die
Far too many instant deaths that you can't see coming and just have to die to know how to avoid them

  I will say that when contacted, Gioteck responded promptly & sent me a new set to replace my 1st pr., but I don't know whether they'll continue to replace each set that breaks. Bought 4 pr.

2.0,False,"03 8, 2010",A1RNKZK9Q8R8GP,B002CZ38KA,Narniak,"Heavy Rain is one of the most massively over-hyped games to be released in years on any platform.  I bought into the hype to the tune of $60, as anticipation of this game was one of the top reasons I finally purchased a PS3 over the past Holidays.  My overall opinion is that you should RENT this one first.

As you can read in most of the reviews posted here, this game definitely has sharp graphics, character animations, voice-acting, and music.  My response is, so what??  This is 2010, so any game that is not strong in these categories is pretty much dead in the water.  Giving praise to Heavy Rain for achieving what should be expected nowadays on the current generation of hardware seems a bit like holding a graduation ceremony after every grade of school, or giving the kiddies loser trophies to make them feel like winners.  Oh yeah, we do that now, don't we!!

The Quick Time Event (QTE) cut-scenes are very well-crafted for the most part, presenting much more lengthy and detailed button sequences than those presented in some recent games such as Resident Evil 4.  The QTE scenes reminded me of those awesome old-school Dragon's Lair and Space Ace arcade games, which I probably pumped over $50 worth of quarters into each as a kid.

My two largest issues with Heavy Rain are that its characters lack depth and substance, and that the story contains so many plot-holes that the narrative often became frustratingly nonsensical and hard to follow; at least it was for me.  These flaws can be overlooked in a button-mashing or first-person-shooter action game like God of War or Call of Duty, but it is completely inexcusable in a game that is presented as an interactive thriller / mystery like Heavy Rain.

As for lack of substance, depth or emotion in the characters, all you have to do is compare the actual Heavy Rain game with the mind-blowing ""Prototype: The Casting"" trailer that becomes available to you about halfway through the game as bonus material.  I'm talking about the trailer where Mary Smith the housewife talks directly to the camera in the kitchen.  It is absolutely amazing, but unfortunately, it has absolutely nothing to do with the actual Heavy Rain game, nor is it anything like the actual game.  Funny how the Gamespot website uses Mary's image with the gun in her hand from that teaser trailer as the main screen shot for their Heavy Rain review page.  Lie much do you, video game mass media hype machine???

I looked on YouTube, and that Heavy Rain teaser came out almost 4 years ago.  It was clearly meant to deceive gamers into thinking that THIS is what Heavy Rain was actually going to offer in the department of character depth and emotion, something that would have rivaled, if not surpassed that of live-action movies.  Nope, sorry gamers, we gotcha good with the old bait and switch!!!

The most dreadful part of Heavy Rain is the multitude of gigantic plot-holes and broken narrative in the story.  The manipulation, deception and border-line lies on the part of the game-makers reminded me of the worst of David Fincher or M. Night Shamalama-ding-dong movies.  Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but you should not have to completely check your brain at the door before engaging in a psychological thriller such as ""The Game"", or ""The Sixth Sense"", nor should have you be forced to do so in a video game like Heavy Rain.

There may be a fine line between a red herring in a mystery story, and an unfair plot deception, but my opinion is that the makers of Heavy Rain went well out of their way to make the narrative unreasonable, and this severely detracted from the game experience for me.  I often found myself asking questions like, ""Why is this character here now, when it was a different character that just received the clue in the previous scenes?"" or ""How does this character even know that character?"" or ""How did this character do that horrible deed, when I was in control of them for all but a few seconds in that one particular scene??""

In summary, Heavy Rain boasts sharp graphics, animations, voice-acting and musical scores, and its QTE cut-scenes work well.  However, the lack of character substance and poorly-crafted story made this game overall a major let-down for me.  Playing this game was like pounding cool-looking square pegs into cool-looking round holes with a cool-looking hammer, while the pegs and hammer made cool sounds, and cool music was playing.  In other words, I found Heavy Rain to be relatively entertaining for a while, but ultimately for me, it was a pointless exercise, and a waste of about 10-12 hours.

The overall look of the game is OK, but the balance is poor.  You have to go on missions to advance the story line (and it seems to imply that if you try to ignore the missions, the game will quickly end, though I haven't actually tried that).  This involves wading through zombies, which isn't as much fun as it sounds, because your weapons are always wearing out and you're always short on food.  When you get bitten four times without food, it's game over, and you have to replay the last 10-20 minutes (or more) since the last save point.  That's the worst part -- the save points are much too far apart, and when you're being dragged along by a story mission, you don't have enough opportunities to seek them out.  So you end up playing the same dumb action again and again.

There are other minor problems too, such as the motocross bike controls being really difficult (I can never get the dang thing to go where I want it to).

This new pair has great sound quality, a detachable mic (which is nice for me since I rarely chat while playing), and is truly wireless--the only wire connects the receiver to the back of the PS4. These headphones also fit very nicely and don't put too much pressure on my ears, which is an issue with some headphones since I wear glasses.

However, after about seven or eight months of normal use, my pair broke at the same point as some of the other reviewers' pairs, leaving one ear cup dangling by the wire. Since I've owned the pair for less than a year, Turtle Beach has agreed to replaced them, but I had to pay the shipping cost to send them the broken pair, and my new pair won't be shipped until they receive and process the broken pair. So, I'll be without a set of headphones for about a month or so until the replacement arrives.

All in all, I like the quality of sound and the fit of the headset itself, and good on Turtle Beach for honoring their warranty and sticking by their product, but I am a bit bummed this pair broke so quickly, especially considering my previous pair from them last three or four years.

Yes, it has pretty PLANTS. Hours and hours of them. But if your definition of ""graphics"" goes beyond ""plants"" then Crysis graphics are dead generic.  For the, ahem...Best Graphics Of All Time I could have used a bit more variety, is all I'm saying.  Apart from the end when things get otherworldly, you're looking at the same stuff the whole time. It's much the same for the enemies.  Not much changes between baddies apart from the weapons they use.  I should add that the ""Korean"" enemies you mow down are voiced with such badly stereotyped, fake accents they left me cringing.  I'm not known for my PC sensibilities, but if Asians start returning this game I wouldn't blame them.

Like Halo, Crysis suffers from Slow Running Character Syndrome.  You'd think that between sprint mode and powered super sprint mode you'd be spared that ""feet in molasses"" feeling.  But super sprint is--bizarrely--only good for 2 second bursts, so you're left ""sprinting"" everywhere in unpowered mode no matter how hard you mash that shift key.  So, cajillion dollar power armor notwithstanding, you leisurely jog through Crysis.  A pretty big design flaw of the Nano suit, if you ask me.  I hope they kept the receipt. You'd also think all the vehicles would help, but the vehicles are fragile, gutless clunkers, which lurch around so alarmingly you're happy to ditch them.  Have none of these designers played that swamp boat level in Half-Life 2 that wore out my grin muscles it was so fun?  What are they teaching in game design school these days that drains all the fun out of vehicular mayhem?

And what ever happened to BOSSES? You know, those things that you occasionally fight at the end of levels which make games vastly more interesting and non-repetitive?  Crysis doesn't do bosses.  It doesn't even do ""boss situations"" where things ramp up in intensity before the level ends.  Your character is there to mark off his checklist and punch out.  Where's the pacing?

What Crysis does do well is firefights.  There is endless, chaotic, gun-blazing fun to be had.  The enemy AI is pretty good which is rare.

It's not a bad game, and actually has some gameplay dynamics that are fun. However, in my opinion, Assassin's Creed 2 (AC2) is ultimately just a decent platformer with a pretty coat of paint.

Gameplay: The setting is the most interesting part of the game. It is set in Renaissance Italy amidst a lot of political intrigue and infighting. Ezio, the protagonist, is trying to uncover a somewhat murky plot while learning the assassin's trade. At the same time, Ezio has a present-day counterpart who shares consciousness with him and can assist in the age-old fight between the Templars and the Assassins. The story is really not the strong suit of the game and is largely forgettable. However, there are a number of quests that are interesting.

The controls are fairly simple and straightforward. Fighting involves timed button input, and movement is controlled largely by the analog sticks. Ezio can get involved in a lot of things in and around Florence, including treasure hunting, pickpocketing, assassination contracts, beating people up, and upgrading a villa. Nonetheless, the routine of it all gets a bit boring after a while and seems to lack real purpose. If you stick with the main storyline, this game should last about 15-20 hours.

The real test of whether you'll like this game is whether you enjoy platform games. That is, how much running, climbing, jumping, and chasing can you tolerate over the course of several hours. For me, the jumping in particular got monotonous early on. For about the two hours of the game, skipping along rooftops is cool. It even looks good. However, after you've chased 3-4 people all over cities and catacombs--and fell to your death a few times, the novelty tends to wear off. Unfortunately, this issue is not mitigated by other aspects of the game. The assassination and stealth dynamics are not particularly engaging and are much better done in games like Hitman and Thief. Anyhow, if you like this sort of platforming, you'll probably like AC2.

Graphics: The game looks quite good. God of War 3 is still the best-looking game that I've seen on PS3, but AC2 does have its share of eye candy. The cities and countryside look especially picturesque. Character models and animations are decent, though they are often repeated.

Sounds: The audio is well done. Most of the voice acting is with Italian accents (or in Italian). Sound effects are convincing, and the orchestral soundtrack adds to the atmosphere.

Replayability/Value: For those who like these kinds of platform games, this is a decent game for the price (now about $20). Don't expect much in the way of replay value, unless you don't mind the collection-oriented side quests (such as looking for 100 feathers and raiding catacombs). I can't strongly recommend the game except for those who enjoy the climbing and jumping aspects, which are in abundance. For others, there are better games out there.","Pretty, but average game",1304899200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This deluxe edition claims to have the booster pack Northern Strike as well but either this is not the case or EA has some serious problems here. Just search the internet and you will find numerous threads on this issue with the game deluxe edition.

In short, the game installs fine claiming that you are getting both the orginal version as well as the booster pack. However, once you are done activating and registering your account you can ONLY play the orginal BF2142 maps with no issues. But once you try to access any of the Northern Strike booster pack maps the game acts like you don't have the booster pack installed and directs you to EA link to purchase it even though the deluxe edition should have installed the booster pack already. I have sent lots of emails to EA but all i am getting are useless automated or cut & paste responses. As of now there is no real resolution to this issue. If EA helps me out I will update my post otherwise think before buying.

Other than that an awesome game. The titan mode is the real winner here. I have been involved in some serious fights around and inside the Titan for supermacy. You have 14 maps of intense battles and the game rewards the players who played the most with more effective weapons as well as armor unlocks and a persistent talent system. I will however, seriously recommend all newbies(until you have unlocked some weps and armor too) to stick with armored vehicles and only try to engage one-on-one if you have the advantage or are in a group.

3.0,True,"01 14, 2015",A3WB5D5Y4E018,B00BI83EVU,Deathberry,"Just like soooo many others, I was excited when I heard this was on the horizon as a next generation game.  It looked fun, sounded cutting edge, and I thought for sure an open world hack-a-thon was going to be the best thing like, ever.  Oh, how far this hyped game has fallen.

Pros:
-While the graphics weren't as mind blowing as they seemed in the previews, they are still pretty good.
-Chicago, where the game takes place, seems vibrant enough on the surface.  Changing weather, citizens going about their lives, busy traffic.
-Hacking mechanic.  While sorely underutilized, I still found it fun.  Most of the puzzles were fairly simple, but there were two that drove me insane (in a fun way).
-Jordi.  Probably more memorable than Aiden.  He was a good side character.
-TBone and Clara.  Also good side characters.  I felt more for them than I did Aiden.
-The music.  A great soundtrack complemented missions.  And the showdown at TBone's?  Loved it.
-The open world.  Chicago felt huge.  Without fast traveling to hideouts, trekking from one side to another actually took time.  And you could have a bit of mischievous fun along the way.
-Sometimes having the option to take people out by hacking the surroundings.  This was disappointingly under played.  I wanted this game to be all about hacking and stealth.

Cons:
-Aiden is a pretty flat character.  He's always brooding and...moody.  I get he has a past, but come on.  No character development.  I really wanted to like this Vigilante persona, a guy who had a cool trench coat and wears a mask.  Alas, there wasn't much personality there to like.
-Conflicting interests.  Aiden is supposed to be played as this good guy Vigilante out for justice.  Well, you could have fooled me.  You hack citizens to steal their money, songs, eavesdrop, spy, steal cars...Hacking for essentials, like security keys, is one thing.  But I found stealing a bit out of touch with what his character stood for.
-Too much a shooter game.  I expected to be able to get through missions by a combo of stealth and hacking.  80% of the time it ended guns blazing and I had very little choice in the matter.  The only non-violent missions were hacking the ctOS locations to gain access to a certain part of the city (of course, you have a choice to be violent).  What's a game about a justice seeking vigilante hacker if the objective is to shoot and kill?
-Take downs vs. kill.  It made very little sense, if any, to have to kill in some missions and find ways to ONLY take down in others.  Random missions where you could only take down targets was very obnoxious when the game is very ""shoot em' up"" oriented.  I liked the take down missions, it went well with the premise, but mixing it up with shooting and killing was senseless.
-Cops.  My god did this annoy me.  They could punch, run me over, and were annoyingly accurate with tailing me.  The free for all with the cops was beyond unrealistic, it was just silly.  I did like taking them out using the hacking mechanic, at least.  Oh, and magically escaping by boat.  Which also didn't make sense.
-Sketchy stealth.  In restricted areas I could effectively hide and stealth around.  In regular areas Aiden kept popping back up like a fricken whack-a-mole.  Getting killed in the process.
-My final gripe is the silly mini-games and repetive side missions.  Boring as all get out after the first 3 times or so.
-Just something that struck me as odd, but people on the street constantly spotted Aiden as the vigilante.  Yet, his sister was clueless and so are the baddies you come across during the act where you infiltrate using someone else's identity.

All in all, it wasn't a horrible game.  The campaign story was all right, I just wish Aiden had more development.  It would've been great to have a Robin Hood side to Aiden, rob from the rich and give to the countless hobos you come across.  Graphically, it was well designed.  The mechanics were 'meh' at times, yet I still had fun with the hack/stealth approach when it was available.  If playing only the campaign, you save yourself a lot of repetition and disappointment.  Lengthy side missions were unrewarding (so many missed opportunities here).  I feel the game was worth the $25 I paid for it...had I paid more I would've felt much worse about this game.","Fun, but only ""meh""",1421193600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1) The graphics is surely a big improvement over the previous Blizzard games.  But it is not truly 3D, the 3D environment doesn't play a role on how the units act.
2) The four playable races are not very balanced. Some are definitely stronger than the others.  The unit generation and interface are very similar to Starcraft, each races are different but still in the same models of the three races in Starcraft.
3) There are plenty of units but all pretty standard.  I actually think the units in starcraft are much more versatile and exciting.
4) The storyline is semi-complete at most.  Major heros pretty much just dissapear after their particular campion(until the last level, which is a dissapointment, see later notes).  And the major bad guys didn't even make an appearance yet. Guess Blizzard is saving all of them for WC4 or an expansion pack.
5) The levels are not well designed. There are not that much varieties. The last level is very dissapointing since it's a defense level, you just need to last 45 minutes and a big part of this 45 minutes are played by computers. (You can help, but not command).
6) Although Blizzard said that Heros play a major part in the strategy, in Multiplayer mode, it probably won't matter since you won't have time to develop your hero and they are pretty weak to start with.

I'll update once I get through the entire game but here's what I think so far.

I've played a lot of games for most of my life (over 20 years, I'm 26) and consumer trends come and go but this generation of HD ports, season passes, micro-transactions, skin packs, exclusive DLC and pre-order incentives needs to stop (don't even get me started on games being released with loads of technical issues including barely playable PC ports). CD Projekt Red is one of few development teams balsy enough to stand up against these practices and games like Destiny are the biggest victims of how content gets made, distributed and released in its original form.

This game is good but so far there is little to no cut-scenes, dialogue or even character exposition. Don't get me wrong, without spoilers, there are 2 or 3 characters that have huge developments but easily pales in comparison to the amount of characters and villians in Arkham City. Arkham City was ridiculous and over the top; every other sequence in the game had batman jumping out of an exploding building, having heated dialogue with partners and villains or escaping deathtraps in even the most seemingly mundane challenges (remember the sharks in Penguin's Iceburg Lounge?). Arkham City went above and beyond in every scenario and always raised the stakes for both gameplay, story and character development. I've been playing Arkham Knight for about 10 hours and I've done 4 things over and over again:

1. Driving the Batmobile/Batmobile Puzzles - Somewhat fun but more additive rather than necessary. The chases look amazing on next-gen consoles but steering is clunky rather than tight and the Batmobile puzzles are so abyssmal they shouldn't even exist. It gets annoying when I come across a problem that only the Batmobile can solve but is bottlenecked by the fact that the Batmobile needs to cross an uncrossable bridge thefore making certian puzzles impossible to solve during the first half of the game. But this mostly effects certian sidequests.

2. Hacking Into Things - It makes sense that Batman can't magically open every door or access every system automatically but this game puts a huge emphasis on doing just that. You're in a militarized Gotham City and for better or worse your biggest problems aren't Killer Croc, Solomon Grundy, Bane, Clayface, Ra's Al Ghul, Dead Shot, Joker, Mr. Freeze or the Mad Hatter but taking out unmanned drones, turrets, tanks and unlocking doors.

3. Beating up Thugs - Free-flow combat always starts out as button mashing at the beginning of every Batman game which evolves into a series of carefully timed mechanics but 10 hours in it's still button mashing. You alternate between hitting and counter-attacking; at some point in the game if you do nothing but these two mechanics you will be overwhelmed - I have yet to be overwhelmed. If anything I don't know how to dodge or counter-attack new enemy types simply because the game gives me no clues as to how to do it. But as long as buttonmashing allows Batman to take down an endless army than why not (I'm on Normal difficulty).

4. Predator Mode- This comes in two forms right now: go underneath grates and swing from rooftops and ledges. The general layout and design of most areas makes it incredibly difficult to take out my enemies in other ways (remember all those turrets and drones?). The fear takedowns are incredibly satisfying but are limited to 3 takedowns at a time without upgrades and you are forced to manually move the camera to your next opponent which goes against free-flow combat.

You glide and fly around as Batman but this is a default, I've never heard of a Batman game where you don't do this.

Oh and boss battles, haven't encountered one yet (unless you consider hitting firefly and a humanoid bat in the face boss battles).

That's it everyone, that's the game so far. Regardless of side-quests, plot twists, character encounters or whatever DLC gets thrown at us at least for me, I'm not expecting an evolution or revolution from the formulas already established in Arkham City. 6 months of story based DLC? Would it be controversial for me to say that this DLC was meant to be content in the main game for its original release? Or that the quality of this game was indirectly/directly affected by this season pass and other DLC content getting pushed out so quickly?

I know this review will be controversial so let me state the obvious. Voice acting and visuals are amazing, it has an above average storyline compared to other triple-A titles and it doesn't mess up core mechanics that were already good for past Arkham games. If you've never played an Arkham game before you will be blown away. I've played them all and this game (at least so far) in terms of quality is above Arkham Origins but below Asylum and City. Outside of the visuals and admittedly experimental story telling there's no freshness to any of this; every character and feature is either returning or has barely changed. Certian things have improved such as the UI and flow of sidequests and the sleekness of traversing the city as a gliding Batman but that and a Batmobile shouldn't be Rocksteady's Swan Song. This is their last Batman game and I feel like they went guns blazing in Arkham City which was 3 years and a console generation ago.

Maybe the last half of the game will change my mind but from what I've experienced so far it falls right in line with all the other triple-A games I've played on my PS4.

Update: 7/18/15

So I've beaten the game and can confirm, at least to my opinion, there are no boss fights; a huge loss relative to all previous Arkham games. The last half of the game puts a huge emphasis on cinematic storytelling to tie up plot holes and tank battles to fill in gaps of gameplay. Everything else I experienced were different variations of the 4 modes of gameplay previously described.

I was hoping for a satisfying surprise ending and although I recieved one it was just as bizzare and canon-changing as Arkham City's ending. Due to this ending I don't know if Batman can go anywhere from here and question whether Rocksteady really wants to do another Batman game ever again.

Bottomline: Too much reliance on tank battles, batmobile puzzles and old formulas and no real boss fights to be found in this game. The game looks beautiful the voice acting is more than up to par and the story execution is as well done as ever (even with a controversial ending). I would suggest renting or buying this game on a discount as I should have done with most of my $60 PS4 videogame purchases and that's just being more honest than cynical. The golden age of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City have long passed and after beating this game I am ready to move on not looking back rather than jump back in - apparently Rocksteady feels the same.

There is no map to track where your enemies are so there is basically no way to tell how close you are to you enemy until you are right up on them. Then its to late and you are getting riddled with bullets. The aiming system also sucks. The game takes place in the 60s so there is no infra-red beam like Metal Gear 2. So there is no way to know who you are aiming for unless you are in 1st person mode and by the time you get that going you have again been riddled with bullets. The graphics are great.

In the end, it's just OK because I can't get around some of the issues:

First of all its wired, and maybe this is a factor of all of us getting untethered.  I never was bothered by wires before I was wireless, now going back seems somewhat limiting.  My XBONE is buried in a ventilated media cabinet, so extending a USB cable out was more of a pain than I anticipated.  It works fined extended, but it still tethered.  So more of a bother than I needed.

Second, I think the shorter right  grip is to make it easier to combo tap the X, Y, A, B, LB, RB buttons.  I've got XL size hands and the lack of grip left me over the controllers center more than I wanted to me.  I'm guessing that kids with small hands do better with this, but I'm a creature of 3 generations of controller stalk habit, and I had a hard time getting used to it, and overall didn't like the feel of the shorter stalk.

No diagonals on the d-pad?  perhaps this is a positive, but it's irritating to lose functionality for using this pad with multiple games.

I think a lot of people did and I think that's a contributing factor to the poor reviews it's received.  I mean, when you're clamoring for a game to be released for more than two years and it's finally released, it's easy to have a feeling of major disappointment when it simply doesn't deliver.  That being said, ACM is not the absolute worst game in the world as many of the reviews would have you to believe.  It's an average FPS with an average story with well...maybe below average graphics.  Alien fans can look it from different perspectives: If you're looking for the intense story line that included plenty of scares and feelings of desperation, then you probably won't find it here.  However, if you're a FPS junkie that likes the idea of a FPS based on the Alien franchise, you might derive some enjoyment from this game.  I mean, it does stay true to the franchise by using authentic sounds (the pulse rifle, tracker and alien screams are spot on.  Not to mention voice acting from the actual stars of the movies).  But it really ends there.  The game is mostly a linear FPS that has you facing Weylan Industries troopers and droves and DROVES of various types of xenomorphs.  That's pretty much it.  I almost felt like I was playing the marine stages of AVP...they are pretty similar.  If you're a huge Alien or FPS fan, I recommend that you wait until this title is around the $20-$30 price point before you buy...renting it would be even better.

Graphics: Now this title certainly doesn't push any folds of visual eye candy, but seeing how this is a Gamecube game port I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. The characters look fantastic and the animations are pretty fluid throughout. The environments on the other hand can look pretty muddy, and the trees leaves can look like flat pieces of paper. I would've prefered Wind Waker cel-shading because at least it seemed to use the power of the system.

Sound: Probably one of the biggest downers of the game. No voice overs, you have to read what everyone says, with only one character with anything remotely similar to actual voice acting. In this day and age, reading what people are saying with no actual voices feels dated... and it is. The music being of poor quality isn't good either. Nintendo really could've upped the production value and have at least a few of the songs or pieces in there fully orchestrated.

Oh yeah, and the Wii-Remotes' speaker tends to make some of the noises sound scrunchy, which is weird seeing how the game Wii Sports sounds from the li'l speaker is pretty good.

Controls: Now this is where things get a bit more fun than just a normal controller. Aiming with the wii-remote is a lot more accurate and fun, and while it isn't a direct replica of your movements, swinging the remote to swing Link's sword is pretty nifty. If I were to have played the GC version, I wouldn't have gotten as far as I had in the game.

Overall, the game just feels dated. Not just in sound, and in some instances graphics, but in how the game plays. It just feels like you roam around Dungeon to Dungeon, solving puzzles and fighting enemies that require no skill to actually defeat. It's terribly linear and there really isn't much challenge to it. Video games are fun when they're challenging. If they can't provide that challenge, there's no point in playing. The formula needs to change or else every Zelda will end up being the same boring game with beefier graphics.

3.0,False,"05 9, 2008",A3MJYQFHRYLUUB,B000U5TVGY,Brandy Alexander,"I just got this game a day ago so I will limit my review to areas that I have played.  The game is played with the DS lite held vertical (think Brain Age) It works nicely for this game too. The graphics a very nice and easy to look at ... Bright but not overly colorful. The music in the game is nothing special and quite repetitive. I think you would end up turning off anyhow since this is a word game.

Now onto actual game play... The game has 3 sections Anagrams, Word Search and Crosswords. The game allows you to have 4 or 5 profiles so it works great for a household of players. The crosswords section looks pretty extensive. Many puzzles are open straight away with plenty  more waiting to be unlocked. I have only gone through 20 of the easy puzzles and they are quite easy. I would say on the level of the EASY and Fun crossword magazines you can purchase at candy stores. They are also quite small. I have solved most in under 5:00 minutes. There is a timer and hints available to you. However using hints cost some penalties As each puzzles is solved it's stamped completed. You can do them over if you desire but it erases your previous solve. The grid layouts vary and the controls work nicely.  You can zoom in a write your answer in the box. If you have written the correct letter it shows up black if you have written the wrong letter it shows up red ! You can erase a wrong answer with a tap of the eraser or simply write over your previous answer. Hand writing recognition is EXCELLENT on this game and  pretty quick too !  My minor quibble is hard to explain but I will try.... When you are are filling in a ""down"" answer , after you write it in it jumps to the box to the right ... you then have to tap the box that you actually wanted... minor and takes seconds  and perhaps it's me  (only had game a day) but I want to mention it anyway. The crossword section is nice for quickie games and relaxation... I have not done the harder puzzles so perhaps they get larger and more detailed later.

I explored the Anagram and Word Section very lightly. The Anagram section allows you to pick your word length. My first quibble with the Anagram section lies in the fact that when you save a game , the next time you  go to the Anagram section it tells you it has found a saved game.  If you don't want to play that saved game it erases it. My second quibble is that when you select ""give Up"" it gives you no score or credit for that game regardless if there was only one word left to discover. The Word Search section is basic and predictable.

In closing I recommend this game. It's pretty easy and relaxing and great for short bursts of time. Quite addicting too. I like that the Crosswords are not too hard...That might put off some buyers .

It does this to revolutionize the franchise which was pretty much a winning streak (minus Ascension) all the way through.
Now, out of all the games to copy from, it sure looks like they tried to move away from an already perfect fighting system.
You should've tried to make this an Original GOW game and not re-doing it from top to bottom.
Openworld not necessary for a good GOW game, but I like that they tried.
Looks wise, well, we all know the game is slick so let's not waste time there.
Upgrading sucks, exploring sucks because unless you have finished the game you will not have what you need to explore everything.
Basically, play the game first like we want or enjoy backtracking a lot.
So did you get that? The devs want you to finish the game and then explore and that is honestly the best option but it sucks you have to do this on their schedule.
Levelling for enemies, I have always hated this as its just a stall tactic and apparently nobody picked up on this.
Makes no sense, just forces you to grind more and then once you and the enemy are on the same level, it is pretty much like all the other fights.
Of course you can modify this by going in overlevelled to make it a cake walk or underlevelled if you want a real challenge but ultimately the mechanic is a way to keep you from going into areas that they don't want you accessing yet, and oh boy do they like to do that in this game.
Travel time and how to get there.
Not fond of this either.
When I first went to use the portal doors, I stupidly thought that I would pick my spot on the map, hit a button, go through the door and re-appear on the other side, magically transported to where I wanted to go, but oh no, we need to add in some conversations and actually make you walk down on otherworldly pathway to the magic door, which by default takes only 30 seconds to a minute, but what a stick in the wheel. Ditto the rowboat. And don't get me started when it comes to going to other to worlds cause it really makes me not want to travel to other worlds.
And it becomes really tedious when the conversations are exhausted and it's only silence for the whole stretch.
Solution: don't put this crap in a GOW game.
Levelling is ridiculous, clearly made to make you play at their pace and then go exploring but so far what I have put on is working and no real reason to go up and look for more until the end.
Nothing was supremely innovated with the copy pasting features of other games.
The one area where I couldn't complain if I wanted to is the combat styles:
The axe is awesome, love the Thor return to hand effect it has and being able to throw it around was nice and then you get a pretty comprehensive bare-handed combat and eventually the sweet, sweet blades of chaos.
All fleshed out with unique moves and upgrades,  and this is the end of any really stand out parts of the game as the rest is more akin to watching a movie then what a lot were expecting in GOW game.
As a matter of fact, the new more personal camera view is a drag when fighting in higher numbers then one, which happens a lot and has been mentioned in many reviews.
I do like the oral cues, like watch your left from the boy and the head but this is not an ideal view for what I want to achieve, it is unfortunately passable so people put up with it, but it may take some adjusting, which is super weird because like I hinted at before, combat did not need to be re-invented in any shape, way or form but it was going to get updated and thats  the real shame here, taking the perfect part of any game franchise and wiping your butt with it instead of using it correctly.
To re-iterate the combat was already perfect and should not have been messed with, as there was no reason.  5 bloody games all the same, all successful (minus ascension) using the same fixed view point.
Yeah that needs to be changed. STAT.
Its one of the most divisive games as far as gaming generations go, the true fans (you know the ones who have played all the GOW years ago multiple times) are now wrinkly old granpas and the new  fans aren't even really fans, you just like this one GOW game cause thats all you played and don't know better. (Im sure there are exceptions and some old schoolers like this new vision of GOW and vice versa)
And it becomes unashamedly directed to younger people, when the Mimir says  A little swole  in the middle of a battle, advising Kratos that his enemy is really OP (overpowered).
Swole?? What genius managed to get that to popular status for pumped up?
Just say he is ""jacked up"" and move on.
But on to a more interesting note, it would be just as jarring and reality breaking if the boy said gnarly dude which we all know that ones been around for a while so I guess it needed the new slang lexicon to you know, practically flat out tell you this game is designed for the younger hipper crowd.
But hey thanks for playing the first games and putting this badass on the map.
And another thing,  pretty doesnt a game make, and this is the biggest bragging rights the game has, the way it looks, and Id sacrifice half of that for that awesome and yes even familiar battle mechanics.
Seriously, I could go on and on...I mean there some joy to be found for sure, but this is not a GOW game.
If this were a true GOW game the emphasis would ve been on bigger badder boss battles, more creature type foes, brutal executions and  proper nipples instead of Nipelheim and not on exploring, levelling up or drawing out the experience just to say ""Like how pretty our game is? Isn't it pretty?""
Which is rarely a minus but I wanted not to have to sit back for 10 minutes of cutscenes and travel time, it became a real deal breaker with me near the end.
Fun game but I miss the GOW 1,2,and 3 when the camera angles were so perfect, you didn't need a joystick to adjust them constantly and could utilize jumps as attacks and to avoid damage, now it's block, dodge or run. (how is that better?)
Also, having read the overwhelming  5 on 5 reviews that are just piling up, one tends to wonder, are they comparing it to the original GOW games or on its own merits, because I can promise you the real fans of GOW are only comparing GOW PS4 to the originals and the twenty somethings who probably never even played a GOW game are in love with this, but THIS, did not put GOW on the map, it was very much there being enjoyed thoroughly by it's true fans and therefore the twenty somethings DON""T HAVE ALL THE FACTS.
Go play all the other GOW games, trust me, they're more fun and more open to replayability.

3.0,False,"07 11, 2007",A1T21Z5M0VKBQS,B000FSS8MO,Richard P. Marsden,"It's been how long now? And I still think Lucas Arts Outlaws was the best Western first Person Shooter. Since that time the Western genre has been oft ignored and only recently had an upswing, with games such as Gun, Dead Man's Hand, and Desperadoes I and II. Still, nothing has been truly memorable and the ""Call of Juarez"" is no different.

Story
The story line is nothing unusual. An out of luck kid (Billy Candle) gets blamed for something he didn't do, while a rentless Bible thumping Reverend Ray chases him. Meanwhile a sinister (not really) plot (not really) draws the two together time and again.

During the game players take control of Billy, who is on the run armed only with his abilities to hide, to use silent weapons, like the bow and arrow, climb things, and use a whip in the same style as Indiana Jones. Sorry, no hat included.

In a genuinely unique twist, players also take control of Reverend Ray and chase Billy down. The two perspectives to the same storyline is interesting, but sometimes I felt cheated as I had to go through the same map twice with each character. Ray is fun. No doubt he alone almost makes the game worth buying at full price. He is mean. He is old. He is quick on the draw and during the game you can have a Bible in one hand a sawed off shotgun in the other. Supposedly the use of the Bible stuns enemies, but I found it more useful just to shoot them, then read from the Bible for kicks. Ray however cannot climb things, and I suppose we'll just blame this on his advanced age.

Gameplay
Gameplay is fairly standard. Characters can lean to the side (a major plus), run and jump. Shooting is easy enough, though even the rifle is fired from the hip it seems. You never use iron sights, though with some weapons you can zoom in.

In combat both Billy and Ray have a weapon which can slow down time. For Billy this enables you to aim percise shots with the bow, while for Ray you can draw two pistols and theoretically take down six opponents with six head shots. Both are nice features, but almost too nice. Much like FEAR, slowing down time made the game too easy. In fact, there isn't anything difficult at all about the game. Health in the form of whiskey bottles are plentiful as is ammo. Weapons eventually overheat and break, but replacing them is no challenge either.

Most the game you find yourself following a prescribed route, and gunning down enemies who at the most seem to show up in groups of four, and usually less. There is some sneaking involved, and a few mountain scaling challenges, but both end up a bit dull. On the plus side, quick draw gun duels are interesting, as is a chase sequence on horseback.

Graphics
I live in Arizona, so I can tell you that the Call of Juarez looks exactly like what a desert in a movie studio looks like. There are cactus and shrubs and a neat haze effect from the heat. What there isn't? Wind. Most things are static (except for falling leaves, pollen and rain) which is ashame since games like Ghost Recon, which are older, had at least mastered the effect of wind moving shrubbery. Not in this game. Thus players tend to follow the, if it moves shoot it, theory. Not that the game will let you shoot innocents, animals, or dead people; for it places a big RED x over them and says, ""No"". Odd for a rated M game. More on that later.

Characters look good. In fact they look great. So good, that you wonder how they ended up in such bad scenery. It's like when you see your favorite actor in a B movie and ask yourself, ""You doing someone a favor?""

Rated M?
It didn't really have to be. The game, for no real reason, has a sexual reference in the beginning. It's a bit akward and nothing else like it occurs throughout the rest of the game. Blood is dark and plentiful on walls when you shoot people, but corpses tend to just get red where they were shot. No smoking bullet holes, or twitching bodies. Language is mildly coarse. Which is fitting given how the game itself is equally mild.

Overall
The game had potential and could have been better with a supernatural twist midway through, or if they wanted to stay in the 'real world', if they had the game feel like a Sphagetti Western. Neither occurs. Gameplay is dull, enemies are too easy, graphics range from good to bad and ugly.
I bought it full price because I've been yearning for a great Western genre game. I'm still waiting. I reccomend you pick ""Call of Juarez"" up when it is about $20. Reverened Ray and his Bible/sawedoff combo is worth that much.

PROS = Reverend Ray. A great character! The graphics used for characters. Chase sequences. Mano y Mano gun duels.

This is an absolute hoot, the first time through, on the second go round it loses a bit of its luster.

You are the Overlord, recently resurrected from an apparently extremely nasty ""accident"", your faithful minions (and I DO mean faithful) have ""cleaned up"" what's left of a ruined tower and are ready and willing to do your bidding.

Controls are different and take some getting used to.  Directed with the thumb sticks you can control either the Overlord or his minions, but without a camera control it makes searching and seeing where you are going a tad difficult.

You use the minions (four types) to reach areas and battle enemies you can not.  Direct your minions to loot, smash, maim, destroy and in general wreck havoc upon unsuspecting villagers and baddies.  Armed with an ax, you too, can join the fun.  Low on health?  Sacrifice the little buggers.  It's OK, really, they don't mind and you can always summon up some more when you've gone through the current supply.

Up on your pop culture references?  Good.  Overlord has them in spades, right down to a well known and beloved Shire.

The minions are a riot!  Watch as they don pumpkins for helmets, chase and pester sheep, break open boxes and fight over the contents, ""That's mine!""  ""For you, Master!""  ""I got pasta!""  ""I drank it"" (They like beer, beware).  I was fully expecting Dwight Frye to appear (heh, heh, heh, the original Renfield of Dracula).  They must have molded the minions after him!

There is one tiny tiny problem, there is no map.  NO MAP!  There is a useless paper one in the box, but it does nothing!  That is the one flaw in the game, you cannot see where you're going nor where you have been.  Bad game design, shame on them!

This is a relatively new technology that adds a layer of realism by dropping real-world behavior into the game using complex real physics formulae.  Believe me, this makes a big difference:  shattering glass, blowing smoke, billowing curtains and more are substantially different.  Unfortunately, if you don't bring some hefty hardware to the table, you'll run into serious problems that make the game unplayable.  Even substantially powerful machines may still have this issue.  Patches have been released to address this issue, but even that success will vary depending on the system and the configuration.

If you are experiencing performance problems, the first thing to do is turn Phys-X support off.  Next, disable anti-aliasing:  the way the world of Mirror's Edge is designed, AA does not add enough to the experience to make it worthwhile for gameplay to suffer.

Mirror's Edge is the first immersive game experience that can truly capture the high-speed acrobatics of Parkour and fuse it with an action game that, in defiance of years of shooters, actually demands that you think of your own survival first. The beauty of it is that there are times when you start thinking like a Runner and suddenly you're doing combination moves that you figured out an instant before you pulled them off: the acrobatics are fluid and seamless and the environment does a good job of guiding you by sparse colors that light the next object you need in neon red.

This game was originally written for the console.  While many console ports are very frustrating on the PC, with Mirror's Edge you get a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it seems like the keyboard is more responsive (and faster) than the PS3's controller.  Aiming is a thousand times easier when you have the pinpoint precision of a mouse instead of the sluggish jerkiness of a thumb stick.  On the other hand, PC gamers know the ropes when it comes to games:  performance can drop at any time, and for any reason--and when it does, in a fast-paced action game like Mirror's Edge you are screwed.

When those beautiful moves don't work, it can be very, very frustrating. Sometimes the combination you need to work to get out of somewhere isn't obvious, or worse yet, it's extremely hard. You may land on a surface, only to have Faith keep moving and slide off the other side, unable to backpedal under the impetus of your jump. And of course there are also ""duh"" moments where the ""wall-run"" key (space bar) being the same as the ""jump"" key means if you're not spot-on, Faith does the wrong thing, and away you go into space.

Which is the scary part: knuckle-biting adrenaline moments where you just sealed your doom play out all the way to the crunch of hitting the pavement. Being shot to pieces leaves you with a slow-mo falling sensation that will give you amusement-park vertigo and near-death-experience chills. I put this down to simple ""oops"" mistakes, but one larger complaint that looms is that you are a skinny twenty-something in a roomful of heavily armored SWAT and police soldiers, some of whom are carrying belt-fed miniguns. You are supposed to get a reward for making it all the way through the game without killing anyone, and I find it extremely unlikely, especially on the last level, that this is possible to do. Even more so, you get a trophy if you can avoid getting shot--I simply do not believe that is possible.

This game has been agony and ecstasy for me, and when I beat it I felt exhilarated. If you are a high-energy gamer who has the patience to try and try again, you will find yourself rewarded. If not, you should know ahead of time that there's no cathartic blasting your way out of trouble in this game.

3.0,False,"02 23, 2010",A3HN7D7HEQGM1R,B001TOQ8J8,Brendan Foy,"I'll just get to each gameplay mode the game offers and share my thoughts.  I never played the first game in the series, so I can not compare this sequel to the original.

The campaign of Army of Two: TFD can be played either in solo mode or cooperatively via split screen or online.  Solo mode is acceptable and functional but on the bland side, you really need to play this game on coop to have fun.  Idealy you would want to play with a friend since there are so many hysterical moments to be had during all of the intense action but you can also enjoy yourself quite a bit if you can find a stranger online who is decent at the game and willing to work as a team.  The game is centered around team work relying on a simplistic but rewarding formula of distract and flank.  You have an ""aggro meter"" shown at the top of the screen for each character (Salem and Rios) which fills up when you fire at the enemy.  The louder the gun, the quicker the aggro bar fills up and the more attention you get.  The key is to manage these aggro bars effectively so the enemy's attention is on one of you while the other flanks them from one side, effectively surrounding them with only two of you.  It works pretty well and even though it sounds simplistic in nature, you are put in some pretty tight binds where some serious thought is needed to get through alive.  You can also lower your weapon aggro with silencers allowing one of you to quietly take out the enemy forces one by one as they rain fire on your buddy.  If things get too hot for your partner, you can remove the silencer with a simple button press and call some of the attention off him.

Aside from the aggro system the coop moments are pretty basic and limited, but still fun.  There are only two instances where you are separated and must work your way to a particular checkpoint to reunite.  One of these was done quite brilliantly, I thought, where you must remain in constant communication with one another to point out where the enemy is in your path and hoping your partner can get in a position to provide some cover fire or clear your path.  Otherwise the teamwork mostly consists of step jumps, combining your strength to open a door, latching onto your partner while he carries a riot shield and two odd segments in the game where you must fight back to back and fire at surrounding enemies.  The first of these back to back segments is pretty cool, you really have no where else to go and have to stand back to back but the second made no sense as you are out in the open but are forced to stand there in one spot and just fire at enemies while exposed.  You also have a countdown to coop snipe or can mock a surrender and quickdraw your pistols together but it's nothing we haven't done in other games without it being touted as a game mechanic.

The campaign is pretty short and not very difficult, though on Contractor mode some of the crescendo moments can prove quite frustrating.  Still, I mainly got stuck due to my partner's lack of skill than game difficulty.  The game has a cover system, use it!  You will be amazed what a little brick wall can shield you from.  I thought the cover system worked well enough and the controls took some getting used to but nothing I found myself wrestling with past the first level.  The only real issue I had with the controls is partner revival.  When your partner goes down, you have to wait a second or two for the game to prompt you to either tap button 'a' to grab your friend to drag him or hold 'a' to heal him.  As you can probably imagine, waiting for this second or so is not ideal when you are being sprayed with bullets, especially when your partner was downed out in the open away from the safety of cover.  I often found myself hitting button 'a' too soon which caused me to sprint away from my partner, and into certain death or to vault over an object exposing myself.  These cheap deaths were quite frustrating but other than reviving my partner the controls were just fine, they just had somewhat of a rough feel which isn't surprising as the entire game feels and looks a little rough around the edges, the budget for this one was clearly cut compared to other EA games.

The best multiplayer mode by far is Extraction which is basically Ao2's version of Gears of War's Horde mode or Halo: ODST's Firefight mode.  It is not as good as the modes offered in those games but it is still pretty fun and definitely looks and feels more polished than the other MP modes this game offers.  There is a 50 point achievement to beat all 16 rounds of Extraction and though the difficulty certainly ramps up, it is doable.  I nailed it on my 3rd try, almost got there on my first.  You will find yourself camping in certain spots to escape death and notice that the A.I. is pretty stupid at times with enemies running right by you because they seem dead set on going after your friend instead, but this can be overlooked for the most part.  Having the achievement already, I'd be more than willing to hop in to help others get the achievement.

The other modes offered in MP are Co-op Deathmatch where you and a partner take on other duos (you can also be your own one man team), Control where your team and an enemy team fight for a designated control point and Warzone which is a 5 round match of varying obectives from stealing intelligence, to protecting targets to arming bombs, pitting two teams of 4 against one another.  These MP modes suffer from lag, disconnects, freezes and just odd little glitches too frequently not to be mentioned.  The matchmaking is terrible where you can join a game and you are out numbered 4 to 2 but then 2 more prople join and the game adds them to the opposing team leading you to be outnumbered 6 to 2!  It happens all the time.  You also can't host your own public matches.  The game modes themselves are not all that fun either, the graphics take a serious downgrade and it feels clunky and tacked on.  There is an achievement where you have to win on every map (6 in total) in all three game modes but I can't seem to unlock the achievement.  This is a common problem, nobody is really sure why it happens, but I feel as if I am laboring through these matches just to get the achievement.  It is not worth it.  I have won everything on every map, but with the constant disconnects and host disconnects, getting a win to count seems like a crapshoot.

So in short, Campaign mode on co-op is a lot of fun and it plays decent while looking pretty good too.  I wish there was some form of interaction with the environment but slapping your friend on the buttocks or punching him in the kidneys is a nice little touch.  Extraction may not be the best horde mode out there, but it is still a pleasant experience, if not rough around the edges while the rest of MP is just a big mess.  I don't see this game having much longevity and with the low budget feel I don't see it as worth full price.  Slash off 20 bucks or more and it's worth a look, definitely a rental.

It's seven months since release and it's still a piece meal assemblage of disparate apps.

It wants to own my media - but it can't rip CDs. I can't play music in the background unless it's one of my snapped apps. It still doesn't have DLNA. It's media control is still pretty basic for TV & DVRs and lacks many DVR control features. The TV lacks numbers. It requires me to name all channels.

The Kinect is better and worse. Better resolution and detection - but audio detection and translation remains very very poor.

The new Xbox One media remote is also very poor (they really want you using Kinect). it's cute but again if you've used the very nice XBOX 360 remote you'll find it quite lacking. it's also not wireless (unfortunately also like the 360 media remote)

Unfortunately Microsoft, as usual, has a very narrow and myopic usage profile. if you like to do the things the exact way they planned then you will be very happy. Otherwise you'll find it very jarring and annoying to navigate.

Don't get me wrong - I like XBOX. That is the XBOX 360. The XBOX ONE still isn't as capable nor as seamless as the XBOX 360.

So if my son hadn't saved up to buy one then I'd have continued voting with my wallet and we'd be exclusively on XBOX 360.

So we have one. But it won't be getting much money or time from us until it has all the missing features (many mentioned above) and isn't so jarring to use.

Sorry Microsoft but I wish I hadn't bought this. If you don't like this review then please just write your own review.

I would have paid for an XBOX 360 MK 2. I.E. Major hardware upgrade but pretty much everything else the same. I need to see if the PS4 is what I really need; can't be worse than this.

I liked the near singularity of the ""gaming box"". As for PCs, when I got the 360 one still had to chase hardware on PCs, and I didn't want to do that. Esp for two kids and I each with their own PCs. So a ""if it's a game for this box it will work"" was a major draw. The other that most of my friends were on 360. So the social hook.

PCs have come a long way power wise, and chasing hardware isn't much of an issue, at least to play most games reasonably well. Other paradigms like STEAM are really disrupting the ""game console"" mode. That said, performance of Steam game ports varies widely, and I have had to juice up my two sons machines a bit. Mostly memory but an opportunistic hand-me-down for the other. Not like the old days but all the non-native code is still very inefficient. Works good enough most of the time.

I think the Steam type paradigm will ultimately win. Especially as with PCs and other devices - Roku, Google TV, Apple TV, Amazon Prime/TV, Cable/SAT DVR, that (1) too many people want to be my exclusive, and (2) they all want $70-$100 or more per year if not month.

Anybody not worried about the lock-ins with the above should remember (do you?) Yahoo Music. Once a premier service it overnight turned off all the servers.

The PC type paradigm is the only things for the most part that can give us the autonomy. Roku to some extent isn't a lock in, but it also doesn't manage ownership of content, and that's a big part of this. But a Roku type device (so ""standard with standard apps and deterministic performance) with some storage and maybe DRM could give us the deterministic behaviour of a box with the autonomy of a PC. (and naturally, PC versions of all the apps).

First off, this is NOT a flight simulator, it's a shooter.  You are the gunner, controlling the minigun, 40mm cannon, and the 105mm howitzer.  The controls couldn't be simpler--weapons are 1,2,3, defensive flares are ""tab"", and the rest is the mouse.  The computer flies the plane, with calm, professional-sounding radio calls regarding direction changes and weapon reloads.  Your view and available range is realistically determined by the bank of the aircraft, and the actual swing of the weapons, so sometimes you have to wait to shoot something, just as it should be.

Don't be put off by the simplicity, though, because this is a lot of fun!  You get a ""nightscope"" view of the ground (really a combination of infrared and thermal, as the troops look just like a thermal scan from a satellite), and your ammo is all tracer-style.  The big guns have a pleasant ""whump"" when they fire, although maybe not as loud as I would like.  The main learning curve is in hitting moving targets--this is no modern lock-on scenario--you have to learn how far to lead your targets.  I regret that I haven't finished the game yet, so I don't know if that changes towards the end, when the missions are closer to present-day (the game follows the history of the aircraft, starting in Vietnam).

The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that in the later stages, the logic seems to suffer a bit.  While the gameplay stays the same, they get really picky about collateral damage--you somehow have to figure out how to blow up numerous tanks that are parked right next to civilian buildings, without the computer complaining that you've done too much damage.  Back off, and you fail because you left too much standing.  Maybe I'll feel differently if I ever discover the ""key"" to this section, but for now, it's really frustrating (and it's too new to get a walkthrough to help get over the hump).

That nit aside, this is one of those games that is just plain fun, because they kept it simple.  Few buttons to remember, satisfying weapons to control, decent graphics (no state of the art stuff, but it looks like its supposed to--gun camera footage at night), and a nice variety of target-rich environments.

Also, I think the Xbox One has serious potential and the problems it will most likely stabilize with in the first year, but do not recommend picking one up on launch.

We finally have all three major console players in the game, with Valves Steam Box hoping to edge its way into the fight for your hard-earned entertainment dollar. Of the three main offerings, the Xbox One has been the last to launch and is the most expensive with $499, whereas the PS4 is $399 and the Wii U is $299.

To say the Xbox One has had a rough PR road to hoe is putting it lightly. Like Microsofts flagship product, Windows 8 with its tabet approach, abolition of the start menu, and closed Windows store, the Xbox One was meant to be a radical reinvention of the Xbox brand, with most of the changes being controversial, to say the least. Initially, Microsoft designed the Xbox One to always be online. If disconnected from the Internet, the system would need to connect at least once very 24 hours, or the system would be unable to play any games. All games were tied to an Xbox Live account and console, effectively destroying the used video game market in regards to Xbox titles. Lastly, the system originally mandated that you use a Kinect motion camera in order to operate the system.

These features were met with such severe consumer backlash to the point that Microsoft reversed these requirements/policies. Still, these proposed policies greatly damaged the publics perception of the system.

Kotaku (among others) have also reported that they have heard from industry sources that Microsoft has been hard pressed getting the operating system and core applications ready for the November 22 launch. Kotakus sources have also suggested that Xbox Ones developer kits are buggy. According to Pete Dodd, a blogger who is apparently well-connected and treated as an authoritative source, post this: So if you are playing by yourself and just playing the game online it should be fine. But if you're in a party, people get dropped. Voice chat cuts in and out. Certain app combinations make the machine crash completely. Apparently there are SIGNIFICANT issues with the Network infrastructure and Xbox Live, and, in the words of Kotaku, these systems will be coming in hot.

So what do you get for your $500 dollars besides the console? An external power brick, a chat headset and controller, a 6 foot HDMI cable, and a Kinect sensor. When you power up the system, there will be a mandatory, day one update (so you better have Internet connection available). The UI is based off Windows 8's approach, so depending on how you feel about Windows 8's UI will determine your opinion of the Xbox One.

The Xbox One is marketed as being the central entertainment device in your living room, which is why the gaming industry and pundits mocked Microsoft during their press conference - the focus was largely on everything else the system did and not the games. The system is able to input and output HDMI audio and video, with the intention of being able to operate your entire entertainment setup using only your voice.

In comparison to the Wii U and PS4, the Xbox One is massive. The system weights eight lbs, is 13.5 inches wide by 10.4 inches deep by 3.2 inches tall, with numerous vents on top arnd around the sides (which it was designed for nearly always being on). Like the PS4, the Xbox One is not backwards compatible. As with most new systems, the launch titles, while marginally better looking than their PS3 and Xbox 360 counterparts, haven't hit their stride in showing what the respective systems can do.

IMPORTANT: Xbox One only connects via HDMI cable; you cannot connect the console to a standard definition TV

While there are several excellent features, most are tied to the subscription based Xbox Live Gold account which is sixty dollars a year. . The following features require the subscription in addition to the monthly fees you already have to pay for several of these services: Netflix, Skype, Hulu Plus, Game DVR, the Web Browser (of all things), and the NFL Application.

The primary selling point is Kinect, where you can engage in all your Star Trek fantasies by talking to your TV and game console and them actually responding to your voice commands. But if we learn from history, its that technology doesnt only work flawlessly, and often times Kinect will not respond correctly. Like Bill Gates getting a BSOD during the reveal of Windows 98, Kinect, while fancy, still has some significant reliability issues.

Although the systems capabilities are impressive on paper (TV, web browsing, video streaming, and a UI that supports voice and motion control), the higher retail cost and continuing subscription fees are significant drawbacks in these economically challenging times. Hardware launches are never easy, and it may be better to just let the dust settle and wait six months to a year for Microsoft to work all the kinks out.

While on paper the Xbox One may be a powerhouse of a system, Microsoft botched the initial reveal so badly that I recommend waiting, especially given all the rumours floating around. Obviously you cannot take every rumour at face value, but when respectable, authoritative sources are reporting sharks in the water, you may want to start looking for fins.",Blood in the Water?

When I saw the Microsoft Store had it on a Black Friday sale for $14.99 I picked it up.  Like many others I believe this game is an initial launch and should have been treated/cost as such.  Think of the Gran Turismo 5 prequel.  It initially cost $40-$50, but they, like Microsoft, soon realized it was not complete and should not cost as such.  Plus GT5 was a complete waste of time. Now Microsoft, Turn10, and Playgound are gouging MS Points and Tokens to expand the game appropriately it comes across as a thinly veiled attempt to obtain more revenue to bring the game up to par.

I have high hopes that over the next few months they will release more locations (which will cost $$) and up to date vehicle packs (again more $$), but for the moment it works very well as a $15 game and with the expanded packs, should they come, it may balance out to a full priced game.

For those who paid full price or worse yet got the Limited Edition I would actually inquire with Microsoft to see if you can be refunded in MS Points or be given some form of credit for helping to establish the Horizon community.  If I paid between $50-$75 for a game and then saw it a month after release at $15 I would be extremely upset.  Horizon has the potential to be a great game, it just needs to grow.  I think Turn 10 and Playground are relying too heavily on there being an always expanding online community.  As we have seen with other driving games this is never the case...See 'Need For Speed Hot Pursuit' for clarification.

While online communities are great, they always fluctuate and there is little incentive to keep going back if your rivals never update and you and your friends move on to other games.

I had high hopes for The Conduit - that it would be an outstanding shooter on the Wii that could compete with the heavy-hitting shooters on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Turns out this is not the case and The Conduit sinks to the level of just being a good shooter ""for a Wii game"".

It's not the graphics that are the problem. I like to think that I don't let graphics influence my acceptance of a game too much (unless there are issues that seriously detract or distract from the quality or playability of the game). The graphics in The Conduit are actually rather well done, especially on the Wii's relatively limited hardware.

The gameplay isn't all that bad either. It's a reasonably fun shooter, the controls handle well, and there are some interesting mechanics involving a device called the ASE, which allow the player to see hidden switches and even hidden threats like mines or cloaked enemies.

It's the story. Ultimately, The Conduit boils down to being simply a ""generic alien shooter"". Aliens are invading, you're humanity's only hope, blah, blah. The Conduit attempts to put it's own spin on the story but really we've all seen and played this story countless times before in other games and movies. I just got so bored with the story I found it very difficult to continue and finish the game - I had very little motivation to do so because the plot was not engaging me or pushing me to play on.

Being a shooter on the Wii, whether it's fair or not, requires something special to break free of the ""good-for-a-Wii-game"" stigma and truly compete with the heavy-hitters (like Call of Duty) in the inundated shooter market. The Conduit falls short. In my opinion, the Wii hardware limits The Conduit's ability to compete on a technical level by default. All that The Conduit has left to stand out with is it's story and art design, and I found that neither were original or engaging enough to make the game truly stand out.",The Conduit Review,1304208000,,,

Thankfully, the game does start off with a much needed tutorial to guide players along in the somewhat complex control scheme but alas most will find themselves resorting to the good ol' button-mash method of gameplay to progress through the 20 or so levels.  Other disappointments include a very poor camera, vague level objectives as well as tired and uninspiring graphics throughout.  All is not lost though, the storyline actually held my interest to finish the single player campaign all the way through.

3.0,False,"02 4, 2002",A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000056PJE,Rottenberg&#039;s rotten book review,"""Dark Forces"" (or as fans say, ""DF"") was the prequel to ""Star Wars: Jedi Knight"" (JK), the game which LucasArts and Raven software expect to follow up this spring with ""Star Wars Jedi Outcast"".  Though all of these games fit the so-called ""first person shooter"" category, the difference in time is marked by the relative advances in graphics, sound and overall gameplay.  Unfortunately, because DF is the oldest, these weaknesses are most obvious in that game.  DF introduces the character of Kyle Katarn, a former Imperial Commando who went solo rather than torture captured rebel spy Jan Ors.  Not entirely won over by the rebel cause, Katarn nevertheless carries out certain high-priority, low-profile missions that require him to sneak and shoot (actually run and blast) his way into highly fortified areas.  In the opening mission, Kyle breaks into an imperial fortress to steal plans for the first Death Star, allowing Princess Leia to obtain them on her way home to Alderaan.  The meat of the story that forms the rest of the game has Kyle tracking down a new Imperial weapon - the ""Dark Trooper"", a sort of souped up version of the regular stromtroopers who've been dropping like flies since May of 1977.  When a rebel outpost is mysteriously wiped out, Kyle goes in to investigate.  Further levels send Kyle to other planets - ice planets, completely urbanized planets (Coruscsant is a stop), planets that appear to be all cliffs, and one planet where you spend a lot of time floating in a sewer (Anoat, which I think was the planet that Han and Leia decided not to go to in ""Empire""; despite what happened in Bespin, it was still a wise choice).  You also travel to Nar Shadaa (the floating city) get captured by Jaba the Hutt (you escape, but not with your weapons), and slink around various spaceships.  The story doesn't carry that well into the game - if not for cutscenes and mission briefs, you wouldn't know what the point of all the shooting was.  The missions themselves seem hodge-podge (you go to various planets to get clues about the new weapon and where it can be located, but little else links one level to another) but come together to form a more cohesive story by the end (the final levels are more closely linked, hinting of the climax).  Though a shooter, DF is also a puzzle game, requiring you to drop your blaster and think for a moment (the power to destroy a wave of stormtrooper is nothing compared to the power you'll need to reach the center of the maze they were guarding).
Time hasn't been kind to this game, and anybody raised on the likes of ""Quake 2"" or DF's own sequel, JK, will likely be appalled by its low-end graphics (this game is circa 1994, and has a minimum hardware req. of a 386!) and MIDI sound (which is similarly unkind to John Williams famous music).  What really kills it is how the game simulate the first-person perspective - there are separate controls for turning Kyle's head sideways AND for looking up and down.  That is problematic enough when having to deal with dangers above (probe droids and mind-probe droids) and below (the sewer monsters).  Combine that with the artificial feeling of Kyle's movements, and you'll feel like you're seeing the world less through his eyes and more through the windshield of a car he's driving (sustained gameplay reportedly induces nausea).  Nevertheless, the thinking-shooter's aspect of the game is more than enough to warrant a shot at this pre-modern game.  Those who complete the game and tire of its levels can download third-party levels designed by fans as well as mods (you can play Boba Fett).  If you are stuck with something lower than a 100 Mhz Pentium and will do anything short of buying one to get the Star Wars experience, this may be the game for you.","An oldie, but not neccessarily a baddie",1012780800,3,,

3.0,False,"02 18, 2011",A2VJJ2POCLMED7,B00005QZT6,Marshall Carter,"Does any name in gaming quite conjure the same sense of gothic action platforming the way that of Castlevania does? From the NES to the Playstation, no multiplatform series has carried over quite so well, with such consistent quality. Even the lesser titles in the series, such as Dracula X on the SNES and the Game Boy Castlevania Adventures and Legends, are well ahead of similar titles in the genre. Castlevania Chronicles brings one of two Castlevania games to never see release on these shores, in this case Akumajo Dracula, a Japanese X68000 PC game (similar to US Macs, Atari ST's & Amigas of the time thanks to the Motorola 68000 under the hood), to the US for the first time, via Sony's Playstation. While there's a valid point that this was the lesser of the two, the other being the amazingly good Dracula X: The Rondo of Blood, a Japanese PC Engine CD/Turbo Duo game, there's no question that it's a more than welcome release to anyone that considers themselves to be even a casual Castlevania fan. The great thing, particularly for those of us that were weaned on the original Castlevania on the 8-bit NES, is that Akumajo Dracula, the game at the heart of Castlevania Chronicles, is in essence, a remake of the original Castlevania. You'll recognize the stages and most of the bosses, the weapons are the expected fare and the music, updated versions of what you've been listening to for years, and in the end, it's a welcome trip down a better-looking memory lane.

Graphics: Castlevania Chronicles' visuals aren't really bad, they're just dated. This is an 8 year old game, and it shows. While the Arrange mode does offer a few updated visuals (new sprites for Simon & Dracula by Ayami Kojima (SOTN), better 'lighting,' etc.), by-in-large, much of what you see is exactly what was there in the original X68000 version. While I would expect this from the original mode, I expected more from the Arrange setup. While the new character sprites are decent, it's not even close to SotN's masterful animation. Graphically speaking, it's definitely no SotN, but then again, it wasn't supposed to be. It's just a shame that more effort wasn't put into the Arrange mode, something that utilized a bit of what the aging Playstation hardware is capable of producing, as in many ways, the graphics are actually inferior to the SNES Castlevania games, particularly IV, and lack the flair that made Rondo of Blood on the PCE so captivating...

Sound: As is expected, Castlevania Chronicles' soundtrack is your usual series fare, which means for the uninitiated, that it's very, very good. The Arrange mode has a completely remixed soundtrack, so all your favorites (Bloody Tears for instance) are here, and in fine fashion. The one minor gripe is the fact that some of the music hardware options of the original mode have been taken out, meaning that there's only one selection available. While this is not a particularly big deal, I have always been of the opinion that the more options you have, the better, especially when all of these sound options can be emulated on the Playstation. Fortunately, all you need do is press L1 + R1 immediately after beginning in order to activate the sound option in either original or Arrange mode, so it's really a non-issue. Hmmm...maybe Konami can put the Minibosses' hard-rocking version of the Castlevania theme in the next one ;)

Gameplay: As usual in the series, Castlevania Chronicles' (or really Akumajo Dracula's) is a shining example of simplicity in game design that works every time. While there are a few areas that subsequent gameplay additions are truly missed (not being able to jump onto stairs, multidirectional whipping while standing still or jumping and separate buttons to control the special weapon), this is still the same Castlevania you've grown to love. Considering the game's pedigree, particularly its links to the original Castlevania, this is actually a throwback of sorts, so it really does not hurt the game at all. As is typical of most Castlevania titles (aside from SOTN, CotM, Simon's Quest and the...ahem...N64 wanna-be's), gameplay is very linear. Basically you have 8 levels, each with multiple 'stages' (the areas between the doors), and at the end, a level boss/guardian. The control is spot-on, and unlike some games, you can actually change direction while jumping. Actions consist of jumping, whipping and using special weapons (all the good ones are hear too). Limited? Sure. Fun? Absolutely. You might not have much incentive to play it through again for a while, thanks to things being so linear (if you've beat it once, you've beat it a hundred times...the exact same way), but while you do, it's a great ride. The only bump in the road is that the game is fairly hard. While that won't be a surprise to anyone who's whipped their way through Castlevania & Castlevania III, it might be a bit much for some of the more casually-inclined.

Theme: I could go into it again, but what's left to be said? Few games have provided more memories over the years than Castlevania, and frankly, I think that's due to the fact that its subject matter is something most gamers are already intimately associated with, and that's the horror movie. Dracula is a character ingrained into the American culture repeatedly over the course of the 20th century, in many shapes and forms. Movies, comic books, video games, he's everywhere. What Konami did was take a great game premise, and then throw in many of the classic monsters & myths we've come to love, recreating them in a way that no one had seen before. Add a larger-than-life hero in Simon Belmont, by all intents just a solitary, normal man standing against the odds, against the Prince of Darkness, with nothing more than his trusty whip, blessed items & a long-standing family history fighting the evil, and there you have it, all in a decidedly Japanese take. Castlevania Chronicles, as a remake of the original Castlevania, effectively takes you back to where it all began, to that very first quest, deep into the bowels of Castle Dracula.

Overall: Truth be told, there are better Playstation games to be had, and much better Castlevania games out there on several systems. Of course, that isn't why you've read this far into the review, you know these things. For what it is, Castlevania Chronicles does the job, and for the relatively low price-tag, it's well worth the meager price of admission. For all the Castlevania fans who have ever heard the name 'Akumajo Dracula' uttered in hushed tones, tried to get the ROM running on an X68000 emulator (more than likely to no avail), or overbid on a copy at eBay, this one's for you, and while Dracula X: Rondo of Blood would have been a better choice (my theory is that it's next to come), Chronicles offers more than enough challenge for those who believed the original game to be too easy. Chronicles is a refreshing look back into a series that has evolved into something much more in recent years, and in looking back, you see just how far Konami has taken the concept, as well as realize, that Castlevania games age gracefully.","An updated version of the original Castlevania, this X68000 port could have been better.

If you like the game flow of the first three silent hill's, then be somewhat prepared to experience something different in this one.

In this latest installment, the first thing i've noticed was that you are limited to what you can take and yes, that's the puzzle of the game.  You will find a document saying in a puzzly way that you shouldn't carry redundant items around with you.  To me, that's an excuse for the creators of this game to focus on ""Melee weapons"" like axes, pipe, golf clubs, etc.  They really want you to go up and personal with monsters rather than killing them from a distance.  Another thing I notice was the save feature.  It isn't all too bad.  I mean, the holes are located on numerous places and usually close by at all times.  It is rather worth a trip to always revisit your apartment and save because if far enough in the game, your apartment gets more absurd as ever!  Also, usually observing what your neighbor is doing as well as who's out your door is pretty fun.

The puzzles in this one isn't all too complicating nor is it too creative like previous silent hills.  I'm guessing it's more combat experience and the unfolding of ""what's going on"" deal.  Not that its bad, but if you do like the weird puzzles like in previous installments, then maybe you'll be disappointed.  The game is pretty short and do revisit old places again as you progress through the game.  It seems like it's been divided into levels because you seem to jump from one place to the next and later going back to them.  The bad part (TO ME, IN MY OPINION)is that revisiting already conquered levels doesn't transform to you know, ""Hell"" like in the other Silent Hill games.  It could of been probably better if the place seems to adjust to hell setting, to you know, make the level a little interesting to explore but it doesn't.  In my opinion on that, Silent Hill is cool with that ""Hell"" or ""other world reality"" thing that other silent hill series had.  Oh, and the radio as well as the flashlight are not included in the game.  Is that bad?.....it all depends either you like playing in the dark with limited visual perception or not, the game is still scary even with the somewhat bright environments.

Another new addition is the ghosts.  To me, I think it's a cheap way of not creating more new monsters so the company can release this title right away.  There aren't that many new variety of monsters in this game and the ghost are indestructable.  They follow you at times and seem to just keep tailing your character to feel you're being followed at times.

All in all, this game is ok.  The combat system is actually the best in the series since this game actually makes you use melee weapon since a clip of bullets takes up room in your inventory and does fit in the game.  Monsters are fun to bash up and do give weird animations.  Controls are easy, the inventory is based on real-time and to me, it keeps the dramatic flow the game going.  uhhhhh, let's see, it doesn't cost $49-$50 to buy but I would recommend=> ""RENTING"" it.  There are four endings, not much secrets to unlock, 1st person view in the apartment surprisingly works very well in this game but more things could have been done with it, which didn't unfortunately.

It utilizes a new Gears of War-esque combat system (touch-and-go shooting with an easy to access duck and cover system) which makes battles more challenging but also infinitely more satisfying. The enemy and ally AI are both significantly improved. Enemies are now far more cunning than they were in the first game, and your allies are actually responsive to combat orders and are now more of an asset than a liability. This game stands with some of the best third-person shooters on the console. The game actually expands on the first ME's excellent dialogue system by giving you karma-based interruption options during key points in a conversation. The game is beautiful to look at and biotic abilities have been improved.

Now, the bad news: Because Mass Effect is now a shooter, the RPG aspects have been scaled back significantly. No more of the first game's vast customization options. Skill growth trees have been streamlined and don't figure too significantly in the action. For those of us who wanted Mass Effect 2 to retain its RPG elements while improving the broken combat system, this is incredibly disappointing.
Another element is extremely disappointing is the new planet exploration system. In my review for the first game I complained that the planets you traveled to lacked variety. But at least you could still travel there and drive around and occasionally find something of interest. The system introduced in ME2 is a complete chore: you scan a 3D model of a planet and click a button to harvest resources from specific areas. This becomes boring after two minutes and you have to spend several minutes just scanning a single planet. And there are multiple planets you need to harvest resources from. What a pain! This just makes the planet exploration option of the first game ten times less interesting. Before, the game had exploration elements, dialogue elements, customization elements, and battle elements. Now the game only has dialogue and battle elements.
The game's plot is weak and has very loose ties to the first game beyond some common characters. Apparently the concerns of the first game have been discarded entirely, and a new enemy has been introduced. And even some of the first game's characters, like Liara and Ashley, have had their personalities radically altered.
The tech specialist class has been undermined by giving players of all classes the ability to open all vaults, thus making the game less replayable.
And finally, the wide expanses of the first game have been reduced to a series of hallways for the second game.

Unfortunately, ME2, while solving one or two of the first game's biggest problems, introduces other problems or makes old problems even worse. I enjoyed playing it, but they could have done much better with this.",Mass Effect Goes Third-Person Shooter,1296777600,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"03 8, 2010",A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001PKHRUK,Armando N. Roman,"When I heard that X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a good game, I wondered if it was a joke. A good game based on a mediocre movie? No way. But I went and bought the game, and low and behold, I was having a blast within the first 5 minutes. No other game has made me feel as awesome as Wolverine. THIS is how Wolverine's other games should've been. No limits on using claws, no toned down violence, no melodramatic plots, just straight up action. The funny thing is that I normally don't like violent games, but this one's just so over the top that it sucked me in.

The story? I didn't pay much attention to it to tell you the truth. You play between the present day story and one from 3 years earlier- Wolverine in the jungle while on a military operation. A lot of it has to do with revenge on his brother Victor Creed, and superior William Stryker. The game's all about action though, and chances are that you won't care for the plot anyway. Wolverine goes from location to location tearing everyone a new one, and taking on some major X-Men characters along the way.

The number of ways Wolverine kills his enemies is impressive. The first one that really got me was when he lunged to a helicopter, smashed through the glass, then pulled the pilot out and held him up so the helicopter blades decapitated him, and created a huge red swirl. My jaw dropped when I saw that since I didn't see it coming. In fact, I replayed that scene 4 times just to do it again- it's that cool. Enemies also get dismembered in different ways depending on how you slash them. Wolverine can also use objects in the environment to quickly dispatch them as well, like wooden spikes, mini-cement mixers, forklifts and more. You have three main attacks- light slash, heavy slash and throw, and then 4 special attacks as well that can be used when you build your Rage meter up. Wolverine also has a great Lunge ability where you lock on to an enemy, and as long as the view isn't blocked or they're not too far/high, he'll leap toward them and you can go from there with how you want to attack. The Lunge is awesome, and I loved that there'd be certain parts where the camera would switch to right in front of the enemy so you'd see Wolverine pop up behind them. Comedic gold right there. Also, Wolverine's healing factor and Feral Sense are here. You heal after a few seconds, as long as you're not getting attacked, and this helps gameplay so you're not constantly looking for health packs. Pressing up on the d-pad changes the visuals and highlights key locations and points you out on where to go next, kind of like the guide feature in Dead Space.

So why the average rating? I wanted to give this 3.5 stars, but since I couldn't I rounded down due to some of the problems. First- the boss fights aren't that fun, at all. These guys take forever to whittle down, even the first boss which later appears as more of a mini-boss. I found myself getting bored. One that really got me was the boss in chapter 4 where I had to restart the battle NINE TIMES because it'd constantly glitch on me, and he'd either disappear from the level completely, or he'd get stuck on part of the platform and freeze, not taking any damage no matter how I attacked. So I had to be very careful with how I fought him just to try and prevent glitches. That part nearly made me quit on the game. Lastly, gameplay gets really repetitive by level 3. Since Wolverine doesn't have a lot of different combos, most attacks look the same and all of them are equally effective.

Visually, the game's a mixed bag. When the camera zooms in on character models, they either look good, or like an early-ps2 game. Cutscenes looked phenomenal though. And you gotta love how they show Wolverine's injuries in-game while he heals. Watching him run around with a hole blasted through his chest was just plain cool. The voice acting's all good too- no complaints here.

While I did have fun playing the game at first, 20+ hours is a long time to be doing a lot of the same attacks and fun-deprived boss fights. This was definitely a great effort on the developer's part, and the game deserves the good scores it's gotten, but the glitches (especially in that boss fight) kept me from wanting to play through it again. Definitely get this though if you want a non-stop action game.",Where do I get pants that regenerate?,1268006400,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I love this game, despite its obvious imperfections (see: other reviews), but one thing I was lead to believe by other reviewers is that it does a good job of representing the fighters...signature moves, poses, entrances, right? I think not. Some stuff is clearly there, but nearly all of the fighters share the same generic animations. And it's not like there are a handful of generic animations...most fighters have the exact same ONE set of generic mannerisms. Even big fighters, who are on the box! I realize it's probably not worth it (or noticeable) having a different punch animation for every fighter, but there are plenty of unique elements about each fighter that are totally ignored.

For example, take Ronda Rousey:

- Reality: walks to the cage in a hoodie with a cold, grim expression. Single stomp when entering the cage, slaps her shoulders and legs
- Game: struts to cage in a t-shirt, talking and swinging her arms. Stands there, waves to the crowd (generic animation)

- Reality: does an armbar with her ankles crossed
- Game: does an armbar with her legs straight out (generic animation)

- Reality: after winning, stands there, smiles shyly and waves, poses with coach Edmond Tarverdyan
- Game: listens for her name and throws her arms up, poses with Mike Dolce (generic animation)

The posing with Mike Dolce, every time! Except in TUF, where he apparently helps train you but then always is in your opponents corner come fight time.

- Charactor design is very good. Looks like characters from the movie.
- Interaction with the envirnment. Being able to pick up and throw objects and the distruction of an urban city makes it feel like you are in a true transformers world.
- The voice overs are decent and not over done or cheesy. Real voices from the film is always a plus.
- Range of playable characters is a big plus too. The lack of characters on the transformers game on the ps2 a few years back really plagued that game.
- The story line keeps the game going. Some movie to game have a real boring story line when trying to adapt a film script to a video game. Transformers does a nice job keeping the flow going.

Cons:

- Controls are difficult, especially while transformed. Driving is just plain frustrating. Alot of botton mashing while fighting other robots.
- Lack of detail for the surrounding environment. I still find it strange that after a year and half of the 360 on the market game developers still do not use the full power of this console.
- Way too many cut scenes. This does slow down the action of the game.
- Repetitive game play. No strategy what so ever. Like I said, alot of botton mashing.
- Not much room for free roam. The setting is just to small for this game.
- I don't understand the purpose of having weapons when every robot has an energy shield. The only way to defeat a ememy is either throwing objects or melee. This does not make much sense.

In conclusion, I think it's a fun game for people who like the music-based style, but not anything special. Buy it used and cheap if you wanna play it - like I did.

1. No online co op. Frankly this was my favorite part of R2 so I have no freaking clue why they didn't include it.

2. The story is non existent. There is absolutely nothing new learned about the chimera or what they are doing here. Also the main character's personality and looks are completely 100% changed from R2. Why bother having the character named Joseph Capelli if you change *everything* about him?!?

3. The campaign is much shorter than the previous 2 games.

4. The boss battles are extremely lacking compared to R2. There are also significantly fewer boss battles, and most of the boss creatures are reused repeatedly throughout the game making their wonder fall significantly.

5. The credits imply that after the end of the game that the chimera are defeated, yet the final cutscene gives absolutely no explanation as to how or why that is happening. All you manage to do is destroy one single building in New York, yet somehow the chimera are defeated across the planet?!? Makes no sense at all. The scale of the story is cut back significantly.

6. The online competitive is the same mediocreness as the previous games. If you like online pvp you are better off playing Call of Duty.

The good parts:

1. Combat is amazing as we have come to expect. If you liked R2 combat you will love the gameplay of this one.

2. The weapon wheel is back and is as fun as ever.

3. The areas that you travel through are amazing and creepy and a joy to turn every corner.

4. A few new types of unique battles have been placed into the game. IE ""traversal battles.""

I have not played the previous games in the series but decided to grab this game and give it a try after the price dropped to around 20 bucks.  In some respects, this game reminds me of the GTA series with a mix of a bit of Far Cry.  I am not sure the gameplay is as smooth as the GTA5 or Far Cry, but it is pretty similar in a lot of ways.

For me, I have had a hard time getting use to the button setup as I have been playing the A/C series lately and gotten use to how to run, jump, etcwith those games.  The graphics are well done in this game as is the unique way the backstory is told.  The cut screens tend to be a bit long though and sometimes interrupt the flow of the game.

Initial install and load times tend to be long as well.  I thought I was done with the install after loading the disk only to find that there is more installing to do that takes several minutes after the title screen loads up.  Not a huge deal, but a bit annoying if you are ready to get playing.

Set in the 60s, this has a perfect soundtrack for the time the game is set in and really adds to the atmosphere. The missions are fun but do get repetitive over time.  The map doesnt seem to be packed with side missions or my least favorite thing to do in games, collectables.  The game could be a bit clearer on how it marks the objectives as well.  The game feels less open world and more linear than the GTA series.  The AI doesnt seem as smart as the GTA series.  The driving doesnt seem to be as smooth as GTA either.  No fast travel is a bit of a bummer with games these days as well.

Overall, I feel it is a solid game and worth playing for the 20 to 30 bucks price range but I don't think it matches GTA5 in overall gameplay, vast amount of missions and side quests.  I still find it enjoyable and engaging to play, even if it falls a bit short to what I have come to expect from games such as GTA and FC.

The separate dimensions and other possible outcomes for the characters is probably one of the few interesting things of this game. But it's buried under the gigantic grind-fest that is this game. You will be travelling over the same maps as Tales of Xilia multiple times! The fractured dimensions is just another word for being forced to travel the same map again. While a lot of the areas are optional, that's practically the entire map of Xillia as well. You don't have to grind, but then you are underlevelled for the fights.

The battle system was alright to me. The changes made it more complicated to me and they keep adding ever more ""junk"" to it. There are so many special attacks that aren't even necessary really. The enemies don't last long enough to bother trying them. The main protagonist Ludger is so overpowered that he's pretty much a Gary Stu, complete with practically no voice. There was the idea of choice in this game, but it was not pulled off well. The choices only seem to affect character affinity, not the game itself. Elle attempts to do his speaking for him, but it just gives you a character that is in place of you, but you can't really change anything about Ludger. They were better off giving him a character because its absence is glaring and leaves the other characters to fill in the gap.

And good luck getting rid of that 20 million gald debt. While it's meant to serve to slow down the game as you have to make debt repayments at certain points to advance the story, it really doesn't impact much. The game gives you plenty of money so that you aren't short to purchase items. It's just annoying in how you have to stop and pay when you accumulate too much money, the bank lady Nova harasses you until you give her some gald. They only have like 7 or so different variations of this conversation, so it gets annoying fast. I ended up giving her everything so I didn't have to hear her annoying voice for a while.

The game does add a few other customized features, Allium Orbs to replace the Lillium Orbs, and a job bulletin board to earn points and money on, which all scream GRIND with their high point system values. At least you have the option to bother with this or not.

I figured for $10 it was worth taking a chance on and I was right.  First off, this game series has been very popular and received very good reviews.  I would say with good cause too.  The story is interesting, Dawn of War follows the struggle of a war torn, and recently traumatized, commander trying to root out Chaos on a planet that is being threatened by a storm and Orcs.  There are actually a lot of different factions vying for power in this game, you have the good humans, the bad humans(Chaos), Orcs, and Vanu, all of whom will fight you, the good humans, as you try to create armies big enough to confront your tasks.  This is a pretty straight forward Real Time Strategy(RTS) game based off of the very popular Wahammer table top role-playing games.  The game works in a series of steps, as do most RTS games, where you start to collect resources, build a base, then build an army, then attack the enemy.  Now that is a very simplified explanation but it serves a a good overview for those unfamiliar with RTS games.  The game has many expansions and a sequel so if players decide to get involved in this franchise there is plenty of gameplay available, both on and off the PC.  Considering the dire outlook for THQ I would highly recommend getting this series now before they go under.  I would like to see more of this game and I would like to see THQ continue to exist.  The game may feel a bit dated but I think it holds its value quite well.  I do find the controls a bit clunky but I assume they will improve as most games do with the follow up expansions and sequels.  Look for this on Steam and you can get quite a good deal.  Why buy it in piecemeal for the same price as the whole bundle.  THQ was also doing a Humble Bundle recently which is a great way to get good games, donate to charity, and support indy gaming, developers, plus the Humble Bundle itself.

3.0,False,"04 11, 2014",A17G8RLZHCFIYF,B00CMQTUCE,Andy Philip Morgan,"It seems that Microsoft is betting the farm on the Kinect 2.0. The price of the thing has caused the entry price of the Xbox One to be $100 more than that of the PS4 at launch. I admit that I have enjoyed the Kinect voice feature (especially controlling the TV). My wife also has enjoyed the Xbox Fitness (games? movies? whatever they are) but those require very little accuracy from the Kinect 2.0. When I say that this game (an original launch title) had been delayed, I assumed that it wasn't the homerun that Microsoft needed it to be at launch and that they would keep polishing until it was.

All this to say, I had high hopes for this game. I hoped for an experience that would justify the higher selling point and showcase the new technology of the Kinect 2.0. What we have here is an average experience that gives hope for the Kinect 2.0, but is ultimately disappointing.

First, I must say that the production value and graphics are quite impressive (and at times, stunning). The water during the jet ski portion is a high point. I will also say that most of the Kinect controls are pretty good. The jet ski game was great, rock climbing was pretty good, Bowling was good, shooting was pretty good, soccer was ... (face palm), and tennis was good. If you're reading all these ""goods"" and ""pretty goods,"" you might be wondering why only three stars. The reason for the rating was because the controls (while good, and pretty good most of the time) were not ""great"" all the time the way a $100 price inflating piece of hardware should be. This was, by far, the best Kinect experience I have had (considering al the connect games on the 360) ,but it didn't feel THAT much better in a way that essentially locks all the consumers into purchasing it.

If we consider this, a first-party, Kinect-only experience, we must be a little taken back by it not being a home run. Sure, game development will improve with time. Sure, there will probably be Kinect games later that will fully take advantage of the hardware. But it is very disappointing that this potential ""told you so"" from Microsoft turned out to be such a disappointment. I hope the best is yet to come from this series and the Kinect 2.0 sensor.

I got this game way after launch and it needed a 20min update just to play, just something to keep in mind as you may want to let it install while having dinner or a shower.

The game is an open world racer, meaning you have to travel to a set location on the map to initiate a race. This is fine if you want to get accustomed to the map, but after you find out that each story objective is half way across the map each time it tends to drag after a while.

Other players also randomly join in your map as it's an always online game. They can join your race also, but they have to be at the starting gate/point the same time you are. At times I see a player stalk me to my next race which is a bit awkward.

The graphics is incredible, very nicely detailed environments especially with the weather effects on the pavement as the ground is always wet for some reason. Frame rate drops down a bit when a lot of thing is happening around you, especially when the cops decide to butt in

The career or story mode is filled with FMV sequences. The acting is over-exaggerated which sets a light tone, but it can get old after a few sequences

The streets are basically dead, aside for some random cars, random online players who join your game, and cops. Yup a lot of cops in this game trying to bust you (probably why there's hardly anyone in the streets). Cop chases are okay, but they take way too long to get them off your tail, but you do get a lot of cash bonuses though if you don't get caught. You do lose a lot if you do, so it's risk, reward.

Gameplay is really good. Controls are similar to other Need for Speed games (like Underground series). Due the the customization you can set how your car controls, the grip and how well it drifts to your liking.

Customization is very good in this game. You get money and experience points from winning races and you use them to upgrade your car's performance and appearance

There is rubber band AI where if you're way a head of the pack, the computer player will randomly catch up to you in a second, even if you're miles ahead of them. It does this regardless of what build you have, making the customization worthless. Don't get me wrong, the various handling is good when you upgrade, but in terms of using it against AI it's useless.

Seeing that it's an online only game, you cannot pause in the middle of a race. So if you get a real life phone call in the middle of it, you have to let it go to voice mail or in a tough race you'll have to hold that itch. Races average around 3-5mins.

Don't misunderstand; I didn't hate this game. The story was captivating, and playing with a friend was a lot of fun. It just seems to me like the people who made this game would want it to exceed its predecessor. Instead it felt like they went out of their way to add nothing to the experience, and in the process, even took a few things away.

Firstly, There is no merchant this time around. In Resident Evil 4 you would encounter a merchant from time to time and would be able to buy and upgrade weapons in the levels. That isn't the case here. You'd better stock up on everything you need before the missions begin, because that is the one and only time you will ever be able to do it.

But even stocking up has been downgraded it seems. In RE4 you were eventually able to buy a bigger case to hold more items, guns, ammo, etc. Again, that isn't the case in RE5. You are given nine item slots and that's it. Now granted its nine slots per person which essentially means eighteen; but you have to switch items back and forth with your partner rather than being able to access them whenever you want.

And god help you if you need to exchange items in battle as opening your cases, weapon changes and item switches are done in real time! This is again in contrast to RE4 where the game would pause when you opened your case. I guess they wanted to make it seem more realistic this time around, but c'mon; it's a video game! I can't organize inventory and fight Zombies at the same friggin' time!

And guess what else you can't do at the same time? Run and shoot. You have to stay in one place in order to unload on your enemies. This is the same as in RE4, but in that game the mechanic blended well with the game play. I can't quite put my finger on it yet, but something about this ""run or shoot but not both"" seemed to clash in RE5. After all the advances made in games since 2005, you'd think they'd try to improve on this.

The long levels and puzzle solving from RE4 also seem to have been stripped this time around. It takes almost no time at all to get through a stage and all the while it feels like the game is throwing the same bad guys at you over and over again. There is almost no variety in the game play or in your opponents.

Now let's talk about the setting. For the most part, it sucks. RE4 was set in Spain and was centered around a lot of dingy towns, eerie castles and creepy dungeons. RE5 is almost all outdoors in a ""may as well be anywhere"" barren landscape. I can't believe no one (at least not to my knowledge) has commented on this yet, but this is supposed to be a survival horror game. So why is almost every stage in broad-friggin-daylight? You just wanna give Chris and Sheva a vat of sun screen half the time! They eventually get it right in the later levels, but for the most part the levels are the exact opposite of creepy.

I know it seems like I've complained a lot thus far, but in truth, the game isn't terrible. The graphics are absolutely amazing, the game is fun to play with a friend and there is lots and lots of Wesker; and lets face it, Wesker rules!

You are going to want to play with a friend by the way! Either that or find someone online to help you out. The A.I for Sheva is the worst I've seen in any game. If the object of this game was to wonder around where you aren't suppose to be, not give me the items I need when I need them, and shoot all over creation at everything except the enemy then it would have been a smashing success. Unfortunately this is a recipe for throwing the whole console out the window.

I know a lot of Wii owners were disappointed that this game wasn't coming to their console. If its any consolation to them; they aren't missing much. To reiterate, I didn't hate the game, I just didn't think it was very good. About the best I can say about it is that it inspired me to play Resident Evil 4 again.

my problem is not with the game Itself...but the Technical issues that come with it.

i ended up beating the game in about 8 hours...only to have my game DELETE ITSELF so that i couldn't play through any of the levels again. furthermore, there was a PATCH that was released that was supposed to Fix this issue...but supposedly made it worse. i figured no problem...ill just play online :) until Every Single Game that i got into, for some reason, Disconnected in the middle of the match. some of them disconnected as soon as they started....and i have a Great connection that iv played Madden, Modern Warfare, NEED FOR SPEED and everything else on...and it works great...but with this game, im disconnected Every Time. i had to use Another connection just to get it to work smoothly. mind you, these are not just My Issues...90% of the people who play this game report the Same Exact Issues.

overall, this was a well made game, probably even the best in the series...but i would not advise Buying it until these issues are sorted out. but if you just want a game to blaze through over the weekend, you can not go wrong with this. if your looking to Buy, i would suggest Hitman: Blood Money instead...

3.0,False,"11 17, 2015",A1BB4H9G9APMT3,B016E70408,Da Jester,"Fallout 4, though extremely engrossing and time consuming like any other game released from Bethesda (or Obsidian), its obviously not without its noticeable faults. Its a game that does well on several fronts new and old, but it can also under perform due to graphical expectations in this current generation of video gaming.

The goods:
* The Commonwealth- Fallouts WORLD has never looked this good. Though still not completely up to par with other open world games like the Witcher 3 or even Grand Theft Auto V, FO4 currently stands out by making post-apocalyptic Boston worthy of exploration and adventure. Details like the unkempt vegetation, various and famous broken down structures, bright blue sky, and even a new dynamic weather system makes the journey immersive no matter what direction you go. The Commonwealth is more open and accessible than anything Bethesda has released and I have enjoyed the many hours exploring it.
*Animations- Combat has been redefined once again to suit the needs of current first person shooters. You can play the game comfortably in first and third person. Not just your characters animations, but also the other NPCs like your companions and enemies also have been vastly improved to make combat more immersive than ever before.
*Settlements- Though purely optional, you can now build stuff in a Fallout game. You can help re-establish civilization by procuring objects, crafting shelters, setting up trade routes, and creating defenses. This is a first for the series and its a very welcome addition that is sure to add more hours with any playthrough of FO4.
* Weapons and Gear- FO4 has a robust amount weapons and gear that come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. And the best part is that each weapon was designed to be look and sound different from the other.  For the first time in a Bethesda game, you can have layered gear. Add shoulders or chest pieces to your vault jump suit. Or go naked and have shoulder pads that have jagged metal attached to them. But it does not stop there. See the next topic :)
*Junk and Customization- Anything you pick up in FO4 like junk and gear can now be used for something. Weapons, apparel, Power Armor, and settlements benefit from the junk you collect. Scrap anything and use the components for a higher purpose. Weapons can be heavily heavily customized as long as you have the corresponding perks and components. Make a laser pistol into a lazer rifle? You sure can! Want to add a bayonet to your sniper rifle? Go ahead!
*Power Armor- Im personally loving this change. Power Armor in FO4 finally feels as it should instead of just heavy apparel you simply just put on easily like in past titles. Though it requires a resource to maintain, its customization and utility adds another optional mechanic for combat situations as well as exploration. Hell, you can have your companions put it on. Like gear, it's also layered.

The Cons:
*The Dialogue System- This is a big change. Your character is now voiced. Though the voice actors are not terrible in FO4, its still weird and feels out of place compared to Bethesda norms. Though charisma effected options are back, most of the time you don't know what your character is going to say or its meaning will be completely different than how YOU intended. Response choices are limited and don't provide the context and in depth options as previous FO games have done in the past. you literally only have 4 variations for most of the dialogue in this game: Yes, No, Sarcastic, and METAL GEAR!? If you were a fan of New Vegas's branching dialogues, FO4 will be disappointing.
*Speaking of, the Story- As mentioned, if you did come from Obsidian's version of Fallout, the forced on story of a vault Dweller emerging from the Vault and into the Wasteland to look for (said) person.....it's not that great to deal with. Though voice acting from the other characters are fine and it seems that Bethesda did put some effort into it,  I hated knowing it was always in my quest log. Whatever character I created, I felt burdened about the main story-line. I will always have this ultimate goal that the game almost makes me feel terrible for not following up on no matter how much of a sarcastic bad person I wanted to play. Also for some reason your vault dweller takes in the new setting pretty OK since Bethesda forced the Mass Effect way of dialogue in the game. And for some reason nobody really wants to question about your existence.
*Textures- Though the wasteland looks great, most of its inhabitants need a next gen overall desperately. Most players will immediately notice the low textures or jankiness of the numerous character models and other objects. The most obviousness are during dialogue segments where Lip-synching can suffer which the results are more distracting than immersive as intended from the camera.
*Still a lot of same ol, same ol- At the end of the day, FO4 is exactly the same game you've played before. It's not completely a bad thing, but for those wanting a next-gen open world Fallout experience, it's probably going to disappoint. Even with the updated combat mechanics, you are playing the exact way as you did with Skyrim or Fallout 3. You still have to fiddle with inventory, go through different menus, deal with weight carry, terrible companion AI, bugs, and glitches. They didnt' bother to even update hacking which I hated in FO3 and New Vegas. Now, I'm not totally hating on Bethesda for the glitches. In fact it would be strange for them to release a game without some weirdness. But at this stage, can we really forgive them anymore? I have yet to experience a game breaking bug, but it shouldn't happen now-a-days if you are paying AAA prices for games.
*Controls- At release, FO4's PC control scheme, whether keyboard and mouse or controller, is not fully bindable. How does Multi-use buttons sound? It should sound awful. You hold down your universale melee button to throw a gernade. You hold the change view button to switch between workshop and normal mode. I want to state that I got used to them, but I didn't. Hell, not even an auto run is here. I really miss having an auto run when I start new character games. A beta patch is testing bindable keys, but, come on, Bethesda! This should have been in from the freaking start!

Where one side of the game showcases an enormous amount of innovation, its the other things that are in need of improvement asap. FO4 for PC is a glorified port from consoles unfortunately. To not sound like your typical PC Master race gamer, I do have to point out the best version of this game will still lie with PC platform. However, which PC version to buy here is the real question. Unless you were one of the lucky few to pre-ordred the Pip Boy Edition, then I strongly implore you to NOT BUY THE STANDARD PHYSICAL EDITION. To combat piracy (and for good measure) FO4s DVD disc does not contain the full game. After registering on Steam, then installing what is on the disc, you then have to finish downloading the rest of the files. Im not super angry about it because Im used to this type of thing with PC gaming. However, for those who have capped internet, you're going to figure out how to download your game somewhere you won't be charged extra for bandwidth use.

Determining if this is worth buying now or waiting is the real question. Like Fallout 3 before, one could get hours of play-ability easily if you dish out the $59.99. If you just rush the story and determine it that way, then you will be missing out on a huge majority of the game and not get your money's worth. But, there is nothing wrong with waiting till it's on sale. $39.99 or even $49.99 for this would be justifiable. Though, we all know that waiting for the inevitable GOTY or ultimate edition would be the best choice for owning anything Fallout or Bethesda related. Unfortunately, there will be a season pass so we'll see if Bethesda can keep us coming back to the Commonwealth.","Even with the Disappointments, it's great to be back in Fallout!",1447718400,5,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC [Download Code]'}",

3.0,False,"07 6, 2005",AA50ZQDY2TPK5,B0001CJEJU,Aaron,"THE TWINSANITY FEATURE

To get right to the point, not Crash's best.  You hardly ever get to control both Crash and Cortex together.  You don't even get to do it in the last level when you enter the Evil Twins' fortress.  THAT ANGERS ME SOMETHING FIERCE!  I CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE HOW MUCH THAT ANGERS ME!  THAT IS THE WORST FLAW IN THE ENTIRE GAME, THE LACK OF CONTROLLING CRASH AND CORTEX TOGETHER!  Anyway, so you DON'T get to do much twinsanity in Twinsanity, so I'd really try thinking of some other name for the game itself.

THE CAMERA

Besides the serious lack of twinsanity, you also have a lot of trouble with the camera, particularly when you're being chased by something, like in Rooftop Rampage when your running with Nina, or in High-Seas High-Jinks, when the walrus chases you.

THE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS

Crash: Crash is the best character to play with, which is good 'cause you play with him the most.  His jumping is a little off though.  His double jumping is not as good as it should be.  Oh, and his high jumping.  In other games, you could jump while crouching or sliding for a little extra hight.  You can't jump while crouching here. You can still jump when sliding but it's very hard to pull off, and it doesn't help it just makes it worse.  Everything is else, except that Crash is too slow, is perfect for Crash.  You shouldn't have to play with him as much as you do, though after defeating Madame Amberly in Academy of Evil, I was glad to switch back to Crash and play with someone I was used to.

Cortex: Cortex's shooting system couldn't be harder to use if you tried.  It's the type of system where the crosshair just appears on the nearest target.  That's usually no big deal, but Cortex's crosshauir jumps around so you never know what you'll be blasting.  This is very hard to use when the bugs chase you in the Academy of Evil, because of the exploding crates.  I think that they should've used the exact same shooting system that Sega used for E-102 Gamma in Sonic Adventure.  You hold down SQUARE (or X, deppending on which system you're playing on), to start a laser.  When an item that can be shot comes within the laser's proximity, it leaves a crosshair on the item.  Release SQUARE or X and Cortex will shoot everything that he targeted.  And if something he targeted requires more then one shot to be destroyed, he should automatically fire enough shots to destroy the target.  Oh, and the laser only stays active for 8 seconds.  It's red for 6 seconds and blue for 2 seconds.  If you release SQUARE or X while the laser's red, he fires normal shots.  If you release it while it's blue, he should fire all his shots in plasma blasts.  And, you should have an unlimited amount of ammunition.  You should have an unlimited amount of ammo in the game even though they didn't make a shooting system like the one I mentioned above.  It should be like when fighting Madame Amberly in Academy of Evil, you never run out of ammo.  Oh, and Cortex's jumping.  He can barely jump at all.  He should be able to jump just as high as Crash.  His gameplay should require bouncing on Spring Boxes (those wooden boxes with yellow arrows pointing up painted on them) and jumping over pits.  He should also be able to double jump.  You should get to paly with him more.

Nina: Nina's a good character and all, but she's still kind of hard to use.  For one thing she's too slow.  She skips instead of just running.  In Rooftop Rampage, you get chased at one point and it's almost impossible to stay ahead because of how slow she is.  Her jumping is like Cortex's, but she can jump a little higher.  She should also be able to jump just as high as Crash.  Her gameplay should also require bouncing on Bouncy Boxes and jumping over pits (well... more then she does).  She should also be able to double jump.  She requires jumping towards rings and grabbing them with her spring-loaded, steel- trap hands.  This could have been easier to do, but it's still not too bad.  It's just that she jumps off instantly after grabbing them.  She should swing on them like Sandy does in SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, and allow you to jump off when you want to.  Other then this, it's kind of fun playing with Nina.  She should also talk in this game, not just keep silent the entire time.  You should get to paly with her more.

THE WORLDS, GRAPHICS, AND OTHER GAMEPLAY

You're going to be frustrated with Twinsanity, frequently.  It's hard to make some jumps, due to bad camera angling.  See, I go to my dad's house and play this game there, since my step-dad won't let us have video games here.  Everytime I finish playing  I relect on how long it took me just to get past one part of the game.  Like, in the snow world, it took me 2 weekends just to pass the part where you snowboard on Cortex's back.  It took me 3 weekends to pass the High-Seas High-Jinks part.  It me a month to pass Boiler Room Doom.  You get to certain parts and then you spend frustrating amounts of time just trying to pass it.  You keep trying and trying and trying, but you die over and over again.  And what makes it nice is, when you run out of lives, you have to work realy hard just to get back to the part you couldn't get past.  The game is harder then it seems, because of the fully 3-D world.  It's a nice addition and all, but sometimes you don't even know where to go.  And the gems are real hard to find.  The best part I'd say is when you're doing twinsanity.  Soemthing else that rcks is the frequent bosses you.  Bosses are a nice break from trying to beat something over and over again, and failing over and over again.  The graphics are not to good either.  Tiny's ugly, Kong's ugly, Pinstripe's ugly, and Dingodile's ugly.  Coco shows up way too little, Crunch shows up way too little, Aku Aku and Uka Uka seem to have almost no import at all to the story, and Tawna should make a reappearence right about now, way now.  Aku Aku masks don't protect you.  Even if you have 2 mask, you'll still die if touch a nitro crate.  If you have a msk and you touch one nitro, you won't die, but you'll lose the mask and start flashing to show that you're supposed t obe invulnerable. But if touch a nitro crate while you're flashing, you'll still die.

3.0,False,"09 26, 2015",A1Q9R4YEKCEANJ,B00QXJFDZO,Cinema Fan,"Let me start by saying this: This game is NOT worth the $60 price tag. I, however, grabbed it for less than $20 used off Gamefly. For that price, I'm ok with it.

First off, the game itself is clearly a love letter to Godzilla fans, and Godzilla fans only. If you're a hardcore Godzilla fan, it's great to see many of the monsters from the Godzilla universe in action, The original music, roar, and character models are pretty darn good, if not, amazing. Simply put, it's the most authentic Godzilla experience you're going to find on consoles.

Speaking of experience, lets talk about that:

1. Godzilla is SLOW. I repeat, SLOW. Don't expect a fast brawler like the other Godzilla games that appeared on Gamecube and Xbox (Melee and the like). This is good AND bad. It's bad in the fact, that well, everything Godzilla does is slow. Clearing stages takes a while and executing moves can be painfully slow. The good aspect of it however, is that it makes sense. In the real world, I would expect a gigantic monster like Godzilla and the other kaiju to be just that: slow and powerful.

2. The dialogue. Good god, the dialogue is TERRIBLE. I will give Bandai Namco props for including both English and Japanese voiceovers. The woman ""narrating"" the game though.......you just want her to shut up after about two stages. The woman gives a play-by-play account of what you're doing and it's just so..........painful. Part of me wants to chalk this up to intentional, in the fact that maybe Bandai Namco is trying to replicate the (often times) horrible English dubs from the films, as kind of a nod to fans. The other part of me, though, just believes that the dialogue is just garbage.

3. The ""story"" mode. Ok, let me try to explain this. It's called ""God of Destruction"" mode. As Godzilla you start level one at a height of 50 meters. You stomp around the stage destroying stuff. The longer combo you keep destroying stuff, the more ""G-energy"" you get, which in turn, increases your height. The taller you are, the more powerful you are. So basically every level consists of: lumber around, wreck buildings, destroy generators, level over. The next stage? Same thing. Rinse and repeat. Every once is a while a random Kaiju will show up. Then you have to fight them. Once you beat them, not only do you get ""parts"" from them (I'll explain this later) but then you unlock them to use in Vs. mode. At certain parts of the story, you have a choice of a branching path, one level might be the ""easy"" route, another might be the ""hard"" route. What this basically amounts to is this: Certain kaiju only show up on the easy stages, certain kaiju show up on the medium levels, only certain ones show up on hard stages. Basically the difference between ""easy"" ""medium"" and ""hard"" boils down the your height in comparison to your opponent. Take for example, if your height is 65 meters, an ""easy"" stage might have a kaiju with a height of 60 meters, a ""medium"" stage might have one of 70 meters, a ""hard"" stage might have one of 100 meters, which means, the kaiju vastly overpowers you.

NOTE: IN ORDER TO UNLOCK ALL KAIJU AND SEE THE FINAL ENDING, PLAN ON PLAYING THE ""STORY"" MODE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

Which leads us to the other modes.

*There's ""King of the Kaiju"" which is just a series of kaiju fights and you're timed.
*There's ""Online VS,"" which is pretty much what it says it is. Play online against one or two other players.
*There's ""Evolution mode,"" which really isn't a mode at all. It's just an upgrade screen. Remember those ""parts"" you got by defeating kaiju I mentioned earlier? You use them here to unlock other kaiju and upgrade your skills. (examples: 180 degree turn, more powerful breath, faster recharge for breath etc.)
 *There's ""Kaiju Guide"" which is pretty fun to look at and read. It's an encyclopedia of Kaiju, including info on the monsters, a photograph, background, and what film(s) they appeared in.
* There's ""Diorama Mode,"" which is basically setting up diorama scenes of whatever monster you want in a variety of positions. Think of it as a ""digital statue manipulation"" I wasn't too thrilled about this, but I guess some people might enjoy it.

So, final breakdown:

The good:

- Stays close to the source material
- Tons of kaiju
- Realistic? Combat.
- Music and sound effects
- Kaiju character models (really great and detailed)

The bad:

- The dialogue
- The ""slowness""
- The monotony of the stages
- The background environments (really reminds me of PS2/Xbox era)

Verdict:

Buy it for $60? Unless you're a ridiculously hardcore Godzilla fan, I wouldn't recommend it. For $20 or under? Yeah. There's enough stuff to keep you busy for a while.",Not worth $60. Love letter to Godzilla fans though.,1443225600,,,

3.0,False,"11 14, 2005",AHSY48775P8RI,B00026D13A,Avalon Daughter,"So Activision decided to jump in on the Sim gaming community and create their own version of the Sims -- Hollywood style. Not bad, but heavily flawed.

The premise of the game is to run a movie studio. It acts quite a bit like the Sims but concentrating more on the community rather than the stars that you create; your goal is to make movies as best and with as much star power as possible.

The Pros:

This game can be fun. You place specific buildings such as scriptwriting, sets, entertainment areas, trailers for your stars and map out a studio lot. You have control over all the decor and can put down grass and flowers to make it look nicer. Apparently if you plant a lot of flowers next to your stars' trailers, it keeps them from throwing tantrums.

The game goes over a timeline. You can start right from the beginning if you want -- I created a ""Clara Bow"" in the 20s and had fun watching her progress. You pick from a line of hopefuls in order to create actors, extras and directors. All of them learn through being in specific movie genres and practicing on sets. Example: A director who has worked on a lot of Action movie sets is not necessarily good in the beginning but results in a great director in the end.

Stars are picked out of obscurity. (However, when you get popular you can find stars from ""other"" studios anxiously waiting at your casting door) and you try to mold them from the beginning. Concentrate on making them over during the correct time period (you don't want a star in 50s outfits by the 60s) and you can eventually give them plastic surgery. Nip and tuck is popular in the 50s, but implants and lipo isn't really available till later in your timeline -- but be careful! Give a starlette a big rack too early in the timeline and they might get negative reviews (remember -- buxom wasn't always popular.)

Recruit scriptwriters, janitors, crew and researchers in order to help your studio progress and keep up with the times. Also, they will make ""suggestions"" by leading a trail of stars. What I mean is, you pick up a screenwriter to drop them into the studio to write, a trail of stars will lead to the genre that is most popular at that time. At my last game, it was the late 50s and according to my news report ""the communists"" sent a ship into space -- which fuels the want of Action and Sci-Fi from audiences. Get it? If you're filming during the depression, no one wants to see a drama -- they'll want comedy.

But you have to make sure that your stars are trained for those genres. When you're placing people into their correct casting areas, the one thing you need to remember is that an actor good in comedy, might not be good in drama. It will tell you as well. Same with the director.

Sets become available over time. There's whole sections dedicated to say, Sci-Fi, Romance, Action, Westerns -- you name it, they've covered it.

Now the more detailed fun is that you can literally have a hand in the movies. You can custom-write a script (which takes longer to do, of course) and add scenes, backdrops, props and sets. Not only can you do this, but you can also finish them and email them to your friends, complete with your ""studio's name"" on them, which, quite frankly, I found to be fun.

Now the bad:

The tutorial is an absolute joke. I've literally had to figure out how to do a number of things including deleting old sets (can you believe there's no instructions whatsoever to tell you how to do this?) and I still don't know how to turn the buildings. Their tutortials are so basic that if you know how to run the Sims -- you don't need to run their tutorials.

Interaction between the characters is limited. You want chemistry between stars? Probably a good idea to simply put them in more movies together. Other than that, there isn't any real detail of emotions.

These Sims are just plain UGLY. They're not pretty and for some bizarre reason, they're kinda a-sexual. The women from the 20-s kinda look like guys in drag. Not only that, but if you custom make over any of them and change hairstyles, you're going to get ALL the hairstyles regardless of sex. Why would I pick a balding comb-over for my female lead? Kinda stupid that they didn't distinguish. You can spruce them up with a makeover but it seems that they don't actually look like men or women until you get to the lipo/implant option in the 60s. I mean, were all women built like hulking men in the 40s? Not really.

Movement is also awkward with these sims and there seems to be some crude humor. It'll say when a star is busy and what they're doing and for some reason, most of the time they're always ""pinching one off"" in the bathroom. Yeah, it's funny the first time, after reading it 40 times you wonder if the programmers are prepubescent kids with a bad sense of humor or if your sims just have serious bowel problems.

You really have to play with this to get the gist -- fortunately, there's a Sandbox option which allows you to really use some liberties -- I'd recommend trying that one first before challenging yourself.

The DVD version is only different from the CD version because it includes a ""Load of Extras."" What that means is, your female star gets a few more hairdo's... that's pretty much it.

This is an EXPENSIVE game, I will say that. I don't think it's really worth over $40 -- I'd say it should be marked at $29.99. It's just not that high tech nor is it that ""fantastic"" of a game. I'd recommend a price reduction before buying it.

3.0,False,"10 5, 2011",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B002BSC4ZS,Tsanche,"When Metroid Other M was originally announced it made quite a stir.  It was a curious being.  Mainly because no one really knew much about it at the time.  The only thing we knew right up front was that Samus was going to be given a voice.  This was something made us all curious but, for the most part we sat back and waited.  In the end, Metroid Other M didn't work out quite as well as I had hoped.  It isn't that Samus has a voice that's the problem.  It is primarily what that voice is used to do and how Samus is characterized.  And we'll get to that momentarily.  Metroid Other M isn't an all around terrible game.  There are some aspects that are quite good.  Gameplay wise, that is.  It's the story and presentation of that story which suffer.

Metroid is primarily known as a video game which provides a lot of narrative through gameplay.  Those who played Super Metroid previously understand this.  The game carries a tale and even has one of the most heartwarming moments in video games.  It's delivered without extensive cutsceenes and drowning us out in talk.  Metroid Other M dispatches with that and provides a story told primarily through cutscenes.  Yeah, much of the narrative is still there and I actually rather liked that Metroid would take a slightly cinematic approach.  The problem with said approach, however, is that much of the story is told through the voice of a monotone Samus who, for the most part... just isn't that vibrant to listen to.  And through the story we fail to learn much of anything about the other characters in it.  Many of Samus's cutscenes involve long drawn out monologues that explain things to us that the game could be showing us... or better yet, letting us actually play and experience.  What compounds this more is that you can't skip any of the cutscenes.  If you get into a battle and lose you'll have to sit through the preceding cutscene once again.

What also compounds this is that the game limits itself primarily to Samus without really exploring the other characters.  It's hard to care about the other characters when something happens to them when we've learned nothing about them.  But even Samus's relationship with Adam isn't fully fleshed out.  This is a man that is supposed to be the most important man in Samus's life but this particular relationship is hardly reinforced through the game.  When we see Adam it's mostly him barking orders.  But there's hardly a moment where we see the two connect.  We have Samus explain to us how much she admires Adam but we never really see this come forth... except through Samus giving a thumbs down as a sign of respect.

The last aspect of the story that takes a backseat through all this is Samus herself.  This is one of the hardest characters to really provide a lot of personality for because this a character who has earned her entire development and reputation through gameplay mostly.  When it comes to Metroid Other M, Samus is portrayed as quite a different character than many of us who have played previous games (and read the comics) have come to understand.  Samus expressing the kind of doubt in herself that she does seems distinctly out of character given how many times she's put herself in danger for the sake of the galaxy.  Some may argue that Samus wasn't much of a character before, but I have to wonder how much time they invested in Metroid to come to this conclusion.  Just because Samus didn't have a voice didn't mean she wasn't actually a character.  As I said, Metroid did a lot of its narrative through gameplay.  We learned things about her through the tasks we have come to perform through the series.  Samus wasn't a perfect character by any stretch.  In Super Metroid we watched her take on a very powerful Mother Brain she wasn't fit to destroy all by herself.  In Metroid Fusion we see how Samus must avoid the SA-X because she isn't strong enough (and the game reinforces this any time you fight her by showing that she can destroy you easily).  Metroid Fusion even gives us a glimpse into Samus's mind by showing us that Samus actually prefers to work alone.  It's part of the reason she's a bounty hunter.  Because she's able to work for herself.  And I also have a hard time believing that a character such as Samus would express doubt in herself when confronting the Space Pirates when she has already done this numerous times before.

But in Metroid Other M we see her doing things like... refusing to use LIFE SAVING procedures just because Adam hasn't authorized that she could.  This contradicts the Samus we've come to know.  The one who has been shown to us through gameplay, and through some of the narrative that the series has presented thus far.  At least in previous Metroid games Samus had the abilities but lost them and had to regain them... or simply didn't have them at all.  But here it's that she has all these abilities... Adam just restricts her from using them.  Meaning that even in moments where Samus's life is on the line she refuses to save herself because Adam won't authorize it.  Even for players who are okay with how Samus is portrayed in Metroid Other M, this is something that even on a design level makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

That's not to say Metroid Other M is absolutely terrible.  It's only to say that the execution of what it does is not that great.  From the outset if someone just told you what the game was about you might actually find it interesting or even worth looking into.  It is the portrayal of Samus and the way the story presents itself that's hard to swallow.  Metroid Other M, as a result, is a game we can say has ""potential,"" but doesn't own up to it.

Gameplay wise, Metroid Other M plays quite different.  It's a lot of fast paced action that's easy to sink into.  There are moments where it's actually a lot of fun, but even here you can see a few flaws that might not have had to happen.  You'll hold your Wii Remote like a gamepad.  You'll run through several corridors blasting away at the enemies while exploring your environments.  It's here that Metroid Other M begins to feel like Metroid.  At least to some degree.  The game is pretty linear.  You'll always know where to go and be kept on task.  And while enemies are crawling all over they're definitely not hard to dispatch at all.  Metroid Other M is a surprisingly easy game for the most part.  The boss fights might have some complexity but Metroid Other M is not going to really test your mettle.  You even have the ability to refill some of your health when you're really low.  This is inviting to those who haven't experienced Metroid, but series veterans might not have a lot of trouble getting through the game at all.

You can also go into first person to blast away some of the bad guys and look around.  You can do this simply by pointing the Wii Remote at the screen.  Metroid Prime this is not, though.  You can't move around in first person.  You can only shoot.  It seems kind of odd that we can't do a little running around or at least dodging attacks while in this mode.

Metroid: Other M is a simple game to play overall.  And at points the gameplay is even a lot of fun to behold.  It is the execution of its story and the treatment of its characters (not just Samus) that really hurt Metroid: Other M.  You'll more than likely be able to play through it just fine, but it's hard to absorb the story it's trying to tell.",Poor Characterization Plague What Might've Otherwise Been an Interesting Story,1317772800,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

After hearing the unanimous glowing reviews for Origins, I decided to get it for myself and for my multiplayer gaming group. The gameplay itself is solid and the levels gorgeous. I didn't care for the character animation, which looked to me like the lovechild of bland Disney imitation and Adobe Flash, but a few friends of mine loved the character art and animation (to each their own). While I thought the levels were gorgeous, I felt like they didn't really stand out on a level per level basis, so much as a world-by-world one. And while the gameplay itself is solid, I also found it really repetitive and thought there was nothing new overall (until much much later levels, where they finally add one 'new' mechanic). I also felt the later levels get really hard without having that addictive 'just-one-more-time' quality that other games such as Bit Trip Runner have.

I decided to take the game to my multiplayer group to see if they dug it. At least, even if I didn't like it, if they did, it would be money well spent. In a crowd of 30 people, it can be hard to attract gamers even when using a large projector. So many of them have out their 3DS or are on other systems. On the large projector, I got maybe 8 different players (not simultaneously, obviously). It seemed to start off well enough, but the crowd just didn't get that into it. After a bit I asked if people wanted to keep playing, they said no. Later in the night, Little Big Planet 2 got a lot more play, so if you're looking for a 4-player alternative, I'd say look there, even if they gameplay doesn't have as much polish (I think they do, but a friend of mine doesn't like the floaty jump), the levels are more memorable and have more variety. Another comparable game would be Super Mario Bros Wii, which I also didn't get that into, mostly because it was crazy hard, but I felt that one was better than this in level design, innovation, and multiplayer interaction.

Update: It's been long enough that I feel I can update/edit this without feeling like I'm giving in to bad reviews or comments. So, first off, I'd like to say one thing I liked about the game is the music. It's really really original, fun, and awesome. It's interesting that the other two games that are most similar to this one, Little Big Planet and Mario Wii, also have great music. I'm glad, great inventive music in games is hard to come by and it's nice to see the platformer genre keeping it alive. Definitely worth listening to on good speakers.

I really do feel there's a bad stigma about 3 stars and 'average'. If you like platforming games a lot, then average is fine. There's nothing wrong with liking an average platformer. I was around when platformers were a dime a dozen on SNES. This reminds me of that time. Unfortunately, I feel it does not hold up to other 4 and 5 star platformers of this or even previous generations, especially given the emergence of inventive indie games. But even with non-indie games, I feel games like Little Big Planet 2 are much more fun. Indie Platformers that should catch your attention: Braid, Bit Trip Runner, Limbo. These indie games are 5 star platformers and amazing experiences. I've also heard Fez, Cave Story, and Awesomenauts are great.","Good, but not nearly as great as other make it out to be",1329782400,9,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

My nights and evenings rapidly sunk back into a gamer lifestyle with more than one Friday night spent in front of the screen instead of in bed.  I was addicted and I still think the game one of the funnest I've ever played.  So, you can imagine my eagerness to pick up the sequel and my disappointment in finding that the designers seemed to go out of their way to make the game less fun to play.  While the new locations are great, the graphics themselves aren't on par with the original. The maps are too limiting as to where you can move, similar to Call of Duty 3, but not quite that bad.  The checkpoints aren't that sensibly placed.  There are too many aggravatingly useless soldiers constantly getting in your way, yet never serving a purpose (their shooting is ineffective and they don't draw the enemies fire either, as if everyone is invisible except you - it's pretty silly watching the enemy run right through a wall of soldiers to go after you).  With the first Resistance you gradually collected an arsenal of weapons that you kept throughout the campaign.  With this one you're limited to carrying only a couple at a time, each level dictating which you can choose.  There are further inconsistencies with how difficult it is to kill some of the larger beasts as well.

Being such a huge fan of the first, I still enjoyed playing this one for the new locations.  But, aside from a few new weapons that are pretty fun, they didn't get much right.  I don't know anything about videogame design.  Maybe Insomniac skimped on the budget, content in exploiting the established fanbase.  Or maybe this fits the cliche of simple inexperience or an overly ambitious effort to fix what wasn't broken.  If they had left the gameplay alone, I could better accept the inferior graphics.

I bought this on a whim considering it's huge price drop since the drop of Rock Band 3... 40 bucks? Eh, what the hell and 3 days later, it was at my door. Mainly, I just wanted to expand my Rock Band 3 experience a little more as the 5-button guitar was getting old and Pro-Guitar is a lot more fun... when I'm not getting frustrated with this controller.

First thing, all the buttons, my god! 17 frets, 6-strings, you can do the math. Big handed people, beware, very easy to activate one wrong button on accident and hit one wrong note in a chord and the whole chord registers as a miss. It's too sensitive and requires too much precision playing to get a streak going. No real guitar player plays with that much precision every time they play a song, there's going to be a dud note in a chord every now and then but this controller is very unforgiving.

The second thing are the strings themselves, they feel cheap and like rubber-bands and the gauges of each string are all the same! If you ever look at a real guitar, the string gauges range from thick to skinny going from the top string to the bottom string. This makes it very easy to not know which string you're hitting since you can't sense it's thickness since they're all the same. The string heights are not even and as far as I can tell, no way of adjusting it without taking half the body apart. For example, on mine, the 4th and 2nd strings are about 1/8 inch below the other strings which can easily result in missing the string with your pick.

The third thing is that the signal on this thing seems to be messing with the signal for my ION's, so whenever I want to play the ION's, I have to take the wireless adapter out for this controller. Minor problem, but still worth mentioning.

Overall, I'd recommend getting the Strat if you can get one as it is actually a real guitar whereas this is just another controller mimicking a real guitar. I suppose for a beginner looking to learn the basics will get more out of it, but if you're an experienced guitar player who just wants to add more depth to your Rock Band experience, I wouldn't recommend it as you can't play this thing like you would a real guitar and you'll find yourself making a lot of adjustments to your technique just to make it work. I personally would recommend the Strat for both players over this controller.","From an already experienced guitar player, this guitar is hard to get used to...",1371340800,,{'Platform:': ' PLAYSTATION 3'},

Comfort both headsets feel really comfortable we prefer the Astros a little bit more than the turtle beach and comfort I don't know if it's because the turtle beach is heavier and the Astros later but when wearing them the Astros To us feel better

Pros and cons, Turtle Beach headset you cannot swap the mic from the left or right side and the earmuffs are not magnetically in place you cannot pull them off like the Astro a 40s.

 After getting these in trying them those are feelings we had to return turtle beaches headset but overall we tend to like the Astros better based on wearing them and using them even though we had a little bit of a problem with the mic on the turtle beaches.

 We truly feel for the money the  astro a 40 headset is the better buy  that's our opinions based on all the reviews and research

below our reviews and research based on opinions of others

 The Astro a 40 headset is still lighter and more comfortable stated in many reviews  in the long run personal preference may appeal sound quality as well but overall the Astros tend to be a little bit better headset even know there's a lot of debate, maybe in the years to come they'll change a few other things but currently Astro  doesn't have as many complaints about the mic's looseness  was still sits on, I don't know if it's the developers the designers with the money or what I'm not sure why this is but it is what it is

 Even wearing glasses it's always been a controversy it's always uncomfortable wearing glasses and headsets.  It's always going to be more comfortable wearing no glasses.

you do the research and find out for yourself,  A 40s not the 50s from Astro,  again people say take the a40 over the 50s, yes the A40 is not wireless but in the long run is much better,  also just to add a note the community advises against the mod kit for the Astro the standard earpieces do better for whatever reason but many of the tests people prefer the standard earpieces over the modded just thought you'd like to know.  Again a lot of these things are important to pay attention to so you don't waste your money and you try to get the best headset currently available on the market.

The headset elite is somewhat close and sound quality maybe user preference to the Astro a40  people tend to prefer the Astro mix amp

The cell shading technique is very unique and makes everything look great, but that's where the good stuff ends. The gameplay becomes tiring almost immediately, and repetitive shortly there-after. Many people have tried to describe what it is you spend your time doing in this new Prince of Persia, but I will boil it down for all of you. You collect orbs, hundreds and hundreds of orbs and they are spread through the various areas, but appear only after defeating a boss. You must explore and re-explore areas to find your orbs. There is no map, and no guide to these orbs, you simply have to fling yourself into every corner of the level.

You can not really die. Whenever you fall off a cliff, your companion will fly in and save you, placing you back on the nearest sturdy landing. This brings a new and annoying gameplay mechanic into play. You actually have to make impossible jumps to collect some orbs. Jump into the abyss, hopefully hit an orb on your way down, scream! Then your friend will save you. That's not too bad, right? Wrong! If you are playing for achievements on the 360, you have limits on how many times your ally can save you in a single play through. If she saves you too many times, you miss the achievement and you have to start the whole game over again which brings us back to our first problem. The game is REPETITIVE and BORING!

3.0,True,"01 2, 2014",A2AZPH033LFE5U,B006FRNASG,Benjamin A. Jones,"A game most will immediately look at and call mediocre. In some ways I agree. The story is bad and there are some things that make absolutely no sense. Characters aren't very likable and the villains are pretty lame.

The stealth aspect is still there though. If you've played the first game on PS2 or any of the Tenchu games then you know what to expect. Sneak up on enemies in various ways and kill them. It works and it works pretty well. You're given (or you can create) all kinds of tools with which to aid you on missions which are admittedly very short.

There are a myriad of stealth kills, however, due to the fast paced nature of the game you'll be seeing the same one or two kill animations often. Others you tend to have to go out of your way to create specific scenarios to witness the other kills. Tools are a blessing and a curse. It's interesting enough to play around with them, but if you so choose, you can make the game a cakewalk by creating bombs that one shot everything.

There are also things from the first game that have been omitted in this one. There is no level editor for one thing. Neither in the form of a level editor mode nor the Garden you got in the first game. Also unlike the first game, you have no reason to try and manipulate the warlords to keep the ongoing power struggle to a stalemate. There is no hidden true ending based on how you deal with them. Instead, endings are based on choices you make at certain points during the story. These are incredibly finite and the endings themselves are lackluster at best. There are also maps that have been taken out. This wouldn't be an issue if there were new maps. Sadly there is only one. Some of the old levels do have some additions though.

The DLC itself is nothing to write home about either. In fact it throws the stealth aspect out the window and wants you to fight enemies head on that kill you in two or three hits. This wouldn't be nearly as bad as it is if the combat system wasn't so clunky.

Story related things aside, there is fun to be had in this game if you're a stealth fan. It doesn't try anything overly complex, the short missions seem to work for handheld purposes, and I personally love the art direction.

Complete with a ""Jackass"" style warning label on the loading screen, developer Running With Scissors (RWS) gambles that they can stuff a game full of enough blood and gore to guarantee an assault by family-values groups, yet still make enough after the lawsuits to turn a profit.  Let me be clear upfront, this game definitely delivers in the sick and twisted department and deserves the ""M"" Mature rating more than any game I've seen.  Postal 2 is not designed for kids, but just like trashy rated R movies, I'm sure this game will be appreciated more by kids than adults.
In order to push the envelope (snicker) RWS enlists the services of the Postal Dude; a goateed Gen-X slacker in a Matrix-style trenchcoat that starts the morning by kicking the dog and shooting the air conditioner for making too much noise.  His nagging trailer-trash wife/girlfriend sends him on a list of ordinary missions like shopping for milk, cashing a paycheck, or picking up a christmas tree (in July), yet the situations our buddy Postal Dude finds himself involved become anything but ordinary.
You see, Mr. ""Dude"" just wants to keep to himself and get through life without being hassled, yet all these people just won't leave him alone.  He goes to his job at RWS and a bunch of video-game protestors bust in and start blasting away.  He goes to the mall to get a book signed by Gary ""I ain't going the the joint again!"" Coleman and cops turn the place into a war zone.  He goes to ... his dad's grave (seriously) and he's captured by a bunch of rednecks, locked in a brewery basement, and turned into a gimp - Pulp Fiction style.
Politically-correct this game is not and you can tell the developers had fun dreaming up scenarios that many will find offensive. Animal-lover?  You probably won't like how the neighborhood cats become a shotgun accessory.  Religious?  You probably won't enjoy the holy war that the catholics and the muslims declare on each other.  African-american?  You probably won't enjoy the ghetto-slang of Krotchy, the child action figure...  I shouldn't need to comment on the violence in this game, but after a particularly bloody and brutal episode involving a meat-processing plant you may not want to eat a steak again.
So you've got a sick sense of humor and not one politically-correct bone in your body.  What's not to like?  The problem with Postal 2 lies in the execution (not the people, the game.)  Like the previous Postal, the graphics and gameplay seem very amateurish compared to the others currently out there.  I didn't think it would be possible to create a bad game using the Unreal Warfare gaming engine, but this comes close.  As a first-person shooter, it fails miserably.  Everyone attacking hits you instantly, sometimes through walls, yet even on the easiest difficulty settings you have to pump about 40 rounds into someone to drop them. ... this game offers almost no interaction with the outside environment.  Even the Postal Dude comments on the cars being ""useless exploding props.""
Most annoying, however, are the godawful load times.  The installation was probably the longest I've endured in any game and crossing from one tiny section of town to the next subjects you to load times resulting in waits of over a minute.  Since you are frequently sent from one side of town to the other, you will spend more time waiting for the game to load than you will actually playing the game.
There are some fiendishly clever moments and I'll stand neutral on the ""garbage-in garbage-out"" controversy this game will inevitably generate.  What I will say is you will need to overlook some serious flaws in the mechanics of the game to be able to enjoy its twisted humor.

The save scheme is another. If you change the options, it saves when you leave the options. If you do a time trial, it saves when you leave. I haven't gotten to any races yet, but I assume it would behave the same. It would be nicer to have a save item in the menu, or even making the save optional, instead of being forced to save.
I found the graphics passible, and, as with GT (and GT2 minus its slowdown and other problems), it looks very bad compared to GT3, but isn't an issue once I get into the gameplay. Nonetheless, of the 4 PS2 games I own, it's easily the one with the worst graphics.
The sound is really bad. The cars sound like wind-up toys, and the music is better left off, which, fortunately, is an option.
I'm going to keep playing, since the gameplay has elements that GT3 is weak at, such as more involved pit strategies, a field bigger than 6 cars, weather and time of day. However, GT3 (and GT and GT2) will definitely get more replay time.
--
After playing some more, the load times are still extremely bad.  Some load time for tracks is understandable, but it's still extreme.  Having to wait through the load screen to go from the track to the race standings or the menus is not understandable.  Also, the ""Race again?  Yes/No"" menu misses the point, as it doesn't circumvent any of the loading.  The auto-save is annoying enough that I pull the save card out until I want to save my progress.
The racing itself is quite good, though.  The weather effects are pretty impressive during the race, the clouds rolling in, or the muted sun though the thinning clouds.  The rainy night racing isn't as well done, as the fake headlights do nothing to light up the road, so it means driving blind over certain segments of the tracks.  The replays have graphical glitches, particularly when it's rainy and foggy, but I've never noticed any such problems during the actual gameplay.  The chunky graphics, however, does affect the gameplay when on an unfamiliar track, as it's hard to tell whether the next turn will be a left or a right until it's too close to set up the correct line.
The normal mode AI is about as stupid as the GT3 AI.  I haven't tried the hard AI.
There is only rudimentary tuning, so there's nothing like the Formula GT in GT3, where each track needed different settings for success.  However, the downforce and tire grades can be changed in the pits, so the weather, tire wear, and fuel usage all factor into the racing strategy.","Long load times, annoying save scheme, terrible sound",1002844800,4,,

The main issues I had about this game was that the weapons were stupid accurate.  You could be walking and raise a sniper rifle and blast people from a very long distance with ease.  You didn't have to stop and crouch or anything of the sort.  Also I thought that sniper was kinda worthless in the sense that you had a person with an SMG about 200 yards away in the open and you were a sniper.  You zoom in to shoot about by that time you are already dead becasue the SMG is just as accurate as the sniper rifle from that distance.  This was the main thing I did not like about it.  Also I didn't know what all the weapons did being futuristic and all.  But I know if I played the game more I would find that all out be do to the accuracy issues I could not play the game long enough to learn everything.

On a positive note I did like the fact that it had a friends list built into the game where you could add friends or join a friends game while playing.  You didn't have to have a third party program such as XFire to add friends or join their games.  Also the maps were pretty good.  The gameplay options were awesome.

That movie gave me nightmares for weeks, and as an adult I can understand why. The sense of total isolation from the outside world, being stalked and horribly killed by a creature you never really got a good look at, and throw in a few angles of betrayal and humanity's inhumanity, and it's no wonder why Ridley Scott's horror masterpiece set the standard for fright for decades to follow.

30 years later, EA Redwood Shores has released Dead Space for the Playstation 3 (among other platforms). Set on the derelict deep-space mining vessel Ishimura, the player assumes the role of engineer Isaac Clarke, sent with a repair team to bring the Ishimura's damaged comm system back online. After a brief cutscene that depicts a very unorthodox docking procedure, the player quickly finds out that the lights are on and someone is very much at home.

From this point on, Isaac enters a bloody and desperate battle for survival, forced to bring the ship's systems back online one at a time before even having a hope of escape. Along the way he will make more than a few horrific discoveries about what has happened to the over-1000 people on board.

GAMEPLAY: $6

The game features the same over-the-shoulder mechanic popular in RE4 and GOW, and adds in a wrinkle or two for combat. Rather than shoot your undead foes in the head, you have to slice them apart using a variety of improvised mining tools.

You will be ordered around constantly by your un-exposed teammates, who spend most of the game safe behind locked bulkheads while you are constantly running for your life. This gets old very quickly, especially since the mute Isaac cannot ask them to please press their lips together.

Also, the enemies you face tend to be somewhat lacking in the AI department. For example, one enemy known as the Hunter cannot be killed, but regenerates and relentlessly pursues you... until you go through a door that completes the objective. Then you can stand on the other side of the open door and watch the Hunter walk around in a circle like the Roman soldiers in History of the World Part I.

On the plus side, the game adds the angle of zero-gravity and hard-vacuum combat, both of which are exceptionally implemented.

GRAPHICS: $10

This is the best-looking game on the PS3. From textures to animation to physics, this game looks stunningly beautiful. It also does away completely with Quicktime events, in favor of seamless in-game events that keep the player in the same perspective, but momentarily turn off the controls so that you can watch something really awesome happen. The ending cutscene is the only actual cutscene in the game.

SOUND: $9

Fantastic voice-acting captures the terror of a small group of people cut off and fighting for their lives. The musical score is wonderful and reminiscent of the first two Alien movies. Best of all, though, is the sound rendering during the vacuum scenes outside the ship.

GENRE-SPECIFIC STUFF: $7

Basically, it's Alien meets RE4. The game borrows heavily from these sources, and while it does these things very well, it doesn't do much in the way of originality. Without giving too much away, I'll reference one of the main themes of the Alien movies, where Sigorney Weaver wondered out loud which species was worse - at least the aliens never betrayed each other.

The fright factor, obviously a must for a survival-horror game, works well for most of the game, until your weapons start to get more powerful. On the plus side, you are always in harm's way when the game is not paused - accessing your inventory, reading messages, buying things at the store, anywhere.

PRODUCTION: $10

This game is one of the most polished and well-produced products available on the console. Story, weapon balance and pacing all work well, but the level design can get repetitive.

FUN: $6

The errand-boy routine gets old very quickly. I would have really loved to go outside more or at least have more time in zero-G, as they did such a good job of it. Way too many hallways.

BOTTOM LINE: $48 out of $60

It's a good rental, but do not pay full price. It does not offer much originality, but what it does offer was given lots of attention. That said, EA needs to concentrate less of graphics and production, and more on things like AI, level design, damage, and improving on their excellent physics engine.

The graphics in this game were pretty good.  Definetely not up to the level of Quake 4 or Doom 3, but being though this is a pretty old game, that is acceptable.  It ran fine on my A64 3400 /w ATI 800XL 256 MB card.  I also have one Gig of PC3200 Ram.  There were no slowdowns whatsoever, however I did notice that the game it self was kind of buggy.  Sometimes if you load a game your enemies would seem to be stuck in an invisible box and they would not shoot or move towards you even though you were right in front of them.  However you still could hurt them. (More on this in a moment)

The sound was OK.  The background music often times became very annoying however.  The sounds that were done best in this game were the sounds of the guns and the enemy chatter.  The ""sniper"" rifle sounded like a sniper rifle and even though your German enemies spoke in English it was very clear that they had heavy German accents which was a pretty nice touch.  It would be very LAME for a game to have Germans speaking as though they are from Alabama or New York.

The gameplay is what warranted my sub par review.  The first few levels were kind of fun and the enemies were not cheap and/or not ""impossible"" to kill.  However after getting to the zombie level, all of that changed.  Having zombies in a video game is already played out, but add to the fact that these things were virtually impossible to kill without having to empty over 50 bullets in those things made this game very frustrating.  THEY JUST DON'T DIE!!!  This is when the game started to turn into a chore rather than just a fun game to play.

After I got by the Zombie level things started getting a little better again until I encountered more enemies that just wouldn't die even though I would empty an entire clip into them.  These two enemies are the female whatever you call them and the Paratroopers.  The female enemies are hard to kill because all they do is flip around all over the place while being able to get accurate shots on you.  The Paratroopers just won't die unless you continuously shoot them with the Paratrooper rifle about 10 shots will do the trick.  Four shots to their heads with the ""sniper"" rifle does nothing and they will continue shooting you even though 4 bullets just went through their head.  Very unrealistic and frustrating.

Another frustrating thing about the gameplay is the ever annoying trigger points.  You observe an area below you and make sure that no enemies are hiding in the corners or behind pillars, but as soon as you jump down, enemies magically appear out of nowhere.  Resulting in you having to constantly Save and reload your game to try again.

In regards to the save/load feature for some reason in the final levels, the Load feature no longer worked unless I loaded a game I saved 2 months ago first.  If I didn't do this, then reloading a recent save game would result in the game locking, and kicking me back out to Windows.  I tried the ""repair"" feature and even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, but it didn't help.  This really made the last few levels very frustrating beacuse after I got killed I would have to load an older save game before I could load the one I wanted to in the first place.

I thought this game would never end and the game just dragged on and on and on and on and on and on.  Ammo was very scarce in the last few levels and yet the game makes you fight more yep, you guessed it, ZOMBIES.  Whoopie.  ""Hey look at me I'm a zombie, and you can't kill me because you have to save your ammo for the final boss""  LAME!!!  Luckily I had some dynamite and was able to blow many of them to bits without wasting my ammo, and I needed every last bit of ammo I had left for the final boss.

The final boss fight was rather dissapointing as well.  It was more cheesy than difficult.  I finished the game last night and will not be playing it again.  And since the load game feature does no seem to want to work anymore, I may end up uninstalling the whole game off my PC.

The original wolfenstein at the time was a very fun game to play.  This game was a nice upgrade to that series graphically and sound wise, but to me it wasn't really that fun overall.  May be partly due to the fact that I HATE hate seeing zombies in video games that just don't die and cheesy AI.","Its an OK game, I never really got into it though.",1160352000,2,,
3.0,True,"08 25, 2012",A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B001TOQ8X4,maskedgamer,"It was hard to rate this game as I gave it a 5/5 on my first impression but months later into it there's somethings I like and somethings that show it's time to move on.

 It's hard to rate this game without breaking it down.

 The attentional to detail,artwork and environment in this game 5/5! The world itself has a lot going on for it. There is plenty to explore and gaze at if you just pause to look around. Detail is everywhere and it really helps with immersion into the game.

 Storyline 5/5 they spent time developing a story that gives you options and keeps you following along instead of just leveling and doing mundane quest to end game level. The world changes and the quest line progresses so that in itself is engaging enough to keep you replaying the game trying different characters for different questlines.

Gameplay 3/5 It's flashy and simple but not very challenging. Compared to GW1 where people complained it was too hard (believe me it could be dreadfully hard) this game holds your hand. It's hard to be killed when fighting normal level bosses. The game is much more generous to you as it has no Death penalty. When before if you were killed on a hard boss it only became worse as you lost about 10% max health each time. The game is very forgiving now and that takes away from the challenge that Guildwars used to offer.

Gameplay Part 2cont. 3/5 the skill sets you use are very watered down from the old format of building a unique set of skills. Each character has 5 main moves and 5 secondary moves. The main attacks alter between weapons and the secondary attacks you can pick and choose. There is a lot less freedom than before when having hundreds of skills and combinations to choose from. That is a main drawback for those that enjoyed the variety of the old game. As there are different skills and weapons there is a set number of skills that you use and after the 100monster or so you kill it's quite redundant. For other games no big deal for guildwars it's a kick down from what we once had.

The game community 2/5! As an MMO the idea is to play along with other players. Over time this concept has changed from people being sociable to Soloquesting Online. Most players in GW2 play alone and rarely interact with other players unless they need too. There are guilds as this is ""GuildWars"" but despite the name it's never been ""Guild"" dependent unless you were doing PVP. I haven't gotten too far into PVP yet but plan to engage in that later when my computer is better capable to handle the lag.

The games community is there but it's non existent as most people just stay to themselves. Even in guilds people will do their own independent tasks and join up for a mission or dungeon and that's about it. So maybe it's a change in MMO behavior or the idea that MMO's are no longer that interesting and new anymore since the idea of playing with someone else online is rather old now there just isn't a need for grouping or playing with other players. For myself as well as old guild wars players its a bit of a let down. After years of playing in instanced worlds with NPC's you finally get a true MMO of your favorite game only to have the actual players run around not engaging with other people and just soloing content. At points I found myself wishing for the Questing NPC's back just so I wouldn't have to quest alone and be so bored. So what are all these people doing? They're ""farming"" which means they're running around to map area's and gather materials to get achievements and make items later on. When people say this game is a ""gear grind"" It's those people that are doing it. The truth is that this game is not a ""gear grind"" it's just the behavior those people choose to engage in when playing this game. They choose to not really be social, they choose to rush the game by not exploring or experiencing the content but just getting from point A to point B, and they choose to make the game all about getting the next piece of equipment. The reality is that the game is amazingly large and detailed and as I said before there is a lot to take in and discover beyond the points of interests listed on the map.

In the past I made the mistake of blaming the game itself for being boring or tedious and casting these people into the grind of this mundane behavior but the truth is that these people do it to themselves. In just about all of these MMO's that have come out. The get into the concept of turning a game into a chore and they stick with it no matter what game they play. Rush to max level, grind for the best armor, then complain about being bored. The community is very different from the old GW community that wasn't so much ""grind"" oriented but ""game"" oriented. If you quested you quested well, if you PVP'd you PVP'd well, You were just playing the game and not necessarily chasing accomplishments they just came with it. The concept of the old GW community is completely gone in the new world. It's been modernized to cater to the grinding crowd which isn't very enjoyable because they never add any substance to the game other than their characters solemnly playing in the background.

The world of Guild Wars 2 really feels split. On one hand you have the backdrop to a great story and goodtimes but on the other hand you have a community that doesn't want to engage in those things. It's somewhat like driving to an amusement park and instead of getting on any of the rides you just walk around the park looking at idle roller coasters and decide to pick dandelions laying about instead. No one seems to take advantage of what the game is offering instead they choose to turn the game into something that's not fun at all to play.

For one, this game is very very dark. Now I am not amongst those people that complained about the darkness of the original. I thought it added a lot to the game overall. But this expansion is almost a parody of the main game. It starts out dark, and gets darker as you progress (you often have to get energy cells, which turns OFF the power and lights). The flashlight doesn't help a lot either. Most of the time, you simply can not see what you are doing. It really isn't fun.

Some of the game is in the spirit of the original. I like going around and find PDAs. However, I thought there was too little in terms of video discs and audio logs. It seems that they cut some costs there compared to the main game.

I also was disappointed that there are practically no new ideas in this game, except for ones that are shamelessly stolen from other games. The ""grabber"" seems like a thrown-in goodie just because Half Life 2 has an anti-gravity gun. The soul cube is really just bullet-time. If you do not play a lot of different games, then perhaps it doesn't matter that these things are stolen from other games, but if you have played the games these things came from, then you will be disappointed, because they aren't implemented nearly as well as in the games they came from. Playing with the anti-gravity gun in Half Life 2 is great fun. Playing with the ""grabber"" in Doom 3 is just OK by comparison.

There also were a few technical problems I had with the original, such as framerates dropping, or the sound completely turning off and forcing a restart. Those issues have not been addressed here. To be honest, I do not find the Doom 3 engine to be quite as impressive as everyone makes it out to be. It is a good engine, no doubt, but from a great engine, I would expect better frame rates at a higher resolution with more crispness.

As someone that owns and has played the previous Diablo games and expansions, I found that Diablo 3 left much to be desired. I played duo with a friend of mine and we were blasting through the campaign on Normal mode with Demon Hunter and Wizard. We then raised the difficulty to Hard, the highest we could go with beating the game at least once, and it was still pretty easy; although we had just reached the low 20s in level.

I think part of the problem is that, in my opinion, a lot of the really good skills you get pretty early on. And even if you get better skills later, their runes (which modify the behavior of a skill) take even longer to unlock so that you are better off using a lower level skill with a high level rune. To me that's a problem because it doesn't make me want to use new skills often.

Even the final boss, Diablo, was super easy.

There are other games, with better graphics, but those are games like Perfect Dark, which has realistic characters that under 64 bit graphics still look choppy and somewhat ugly compared to the newer consoles.

3.0,False,"01 5, 2010",A11JU33HMT5XPU,B00004SVMY,S. Lawrenz,"Bad Dudes for the NES is a port of the Japanese arcade game of the same name. The game starts out with a fellow who looks a lot like Duke Nukem informing the player that the US President (President Ronnie, a Reagan lookalike) has been kidnapped by ninjas and asking if the player is a ""bad enough dude to rescue the president.""  Thus the player sets out to rescue the president from the ninjas. Frankly, I doubt that the guy assigning the mission was actually intended to look like Duke Nukem, but boy, he sure does. I got a good laugh the first time I played the game.

Bad Dudes is a fighting platformer that has gameplay somewhat similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Dragon/dp/B000E7FTPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Dragon</a>.  Like Double Dragon, the player must fight enemies on multiple levels and use dropped power ups to recharge and fight.  While this game does have a two player mode, it is not co-op like the original arcade version, but alternates between players instead. Like Shinobi numerous enemies, sometimes four at a time, come at the player, who must fend them off with jumps, kicks, punches and the occasional weapon power up.

Unfortunately, Bad Dudes has some problems with it that make it a lackluster game.  First of all, the main character jerks across the screen with what looks like three frames of walking animation.  This makes control seem sluggish. Enemies that come at the player have heavy flicker when they touch him which make them hard to see and interfere with the player character's animation as well.  The result is a quick paced mess that gets a little hard on the eyes after a while.  I suspect that a lot of this has to do with programing limitations due to the NES hardware which can only display so many sprites at one time (That includes background elements).  With such limitations, to emulate the arcade's fast paced gameplay and numerous enemies, the addition of flicker was needed. Regardless, it's distracting and tiring on the eyes.

Because of that and the gameplay design, this game is pretty hard for the player who isn't entirely used to playing this type of game. It's fairly unforgiving in terms of gameplay and the player receives three lives to start out the game. I'm not terrible at platformers, but this took me a bit of work to get very many levels into it. It's a grueling and I'd say, not nearly as fun as the other two games I mentioned earlier.

On the other side of the coin, the musical tracks for Bad Dudes are unique and driving tunes that enhance the gameplay and move the game forward.

Bottom line, however, Bad Dudes is a mediocre title.  Perhaps with better character animations and less flicker it wouldn't be quite as obnoxious to watch. Other titles such as Double Dragon are a bit more fun to boot.

5 stars for game-play and collector's content.
The game-play is great. The training sessions are even fun.
The Comic is a good read and The thumb-drive with SC1 and Brood War pre-installed is genius. The Thumb-Drive alone is worth the extra cash. The behind the scenes DVD is neat to see. and the music CD is a nice touch.

I was very impressed after the initial install let down.

I just finished the game and have a few additional thoughts. First off this game is EASY on normal mode. If you have played Brood, you may want to start on the hard level to make it more challenging. I played through all but the last episode quickly then went back and replayed at harder levels. I am not sure if it is a bug or not but when I replayed the episodes on the harder level I ended up getting more cash for cashing in the zerg and protoss points. So I have all armory upgrades because of the extra income. With all the upgrades every thing is very easy.

The original ""Katamari"" was quirky, unexpected, charmingly simple, with a cast of strange characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Unfortunately, the sequel is bland by comparison.

What made ""Katamari Damacy"" good? It was PRECISELY its originality. Where then is the originality for the sequel (which incidentally is priced 10 bucks higher than its predecessor)? That's not to say that rolling the katamari still isn't fun, but there really is NOTHING new here!

This one for me even on easy seems a bit more difficult for my skills. I was able to beat it fairly quickly and the Devil went down but it took some time.

One of my favorite parts of the Saints games are creating my character this one does not allow for that. You can play Johnny Gat or Kinzie.

Also, I've been stuck in a few glitches where I was warped into the middle of a building that wouldn't let me exit. It was a glass building but I saved my progress and just restarted the game.

3.0,True,"07 6, 2013",A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B002BRZ6UE,AUTISTIC WEREWOLF,"I played Crysis 1 and it was quite good almost everything this game is not.  First the Crysis 2 story is painfully boring.  You spend most of the time running around cleaning up messes made by arrogant halfwits like Dr. Gould.  The good guys among the military are all dim wits and all the bad guys are criminal masterminds at plotting strikes against you.  The guns are all jokes as they are not powerful at all against enemies.  The Nanosuit is so weak and lame it is pathetic.  The controls for suit powers seldom work as they are supposed to.  The game freezes while you are taught things about the suit or given ""options"" that do not really change anything.  The game is more difficult that Crysis 1 not because it is better.  Crysis 2 is more difficult because it is so glitch ridden that you win battles only on the rare occasion when your powers and guns work as expected.  I think the graphics are good but Mass Effect 2 and even Infamous 2 had graphics on par with Crysis 2 without the glitch a minute features of Crysis 2.  In Crysis 2 the scenery changed often but the missions were all to often painfully similar.  The enemy almost always had the jump on you and seldom the other way around.  The cloak ran out just in time to not be useful.  The AI was stupid given that enemies who had no line of sight to your hiding place would suddenly appear to open fire on your the minute you engaged a target.  The stealth kill commands seldom worked as they should.  The rocket propelled grenade launcher did not cycle to the next warhead after the active one was used.  You had to shoot one enemy a dozen times before they went down.  The enemy could often kill you in a few shots or blows.  The autosaves were very far apart so if you did die in game you were thrown back to a point where it would take 25 minutes or more to get back to where you were before you died.

The most annoying thing the Crysis 2 game does is as you move to new chapters you rarely get to keep the awesome guns you collect.  If you are like me when playing one of these games you develop a relationship with certain weapons.  Yes I can use any weapon in a well designed game that is not glitch which of course can't be said about Crysis 2.  However even in Crysis 2 there were some weapons that worked well every time.  The Mike X43 Cannon was particularly effective at toasting aliens ala-the popcorn achievement \ trophy. The rocket ganade was great when it worked. The ranged and sniper Scarab were also nice.  All the pistols were weak and upon entering a new chapter you were always given a cheap pistol and had to hunt down great weapons all over again just to lose them all again next chapter.  Developers of Crysis 2 have excitement the definition of confused with tedium.  Finding the same weapons over and over again is just plain tedious and so not fun at all!

The keys, dog tags and emails collectibles blended into the most of their backgrounds so completely they were almost cloaked.  The action buttons seldom appeared immediately when you had to interact with objects in the environment.  You had to wiggle the controller just right to get some interaction buttons to appear which often can get you killed trying because using a game object meant positioning yourself just right in relation to the buttons valid appear area. There were plenty of glitches where you could see enemies shooting at you while caught halfway between walls.  Of course there were glitches that caused me to restart whole chapters. EA does a terrible job of quality control, they need some autistic game testers in quality control we find all the flaws.  Crysis 2 was not a completely bad game but, Crysis 2 was nothing at all special.  If Crysis 2 was put out by a second tier studio on a budget it would have been a nice game.  However Crysis 2 was supposed to be a great game and it was painfully average to mediocre at best.  I did beat Crysis 2 so I am happy.  I got a few trophies not many because; so many trophies reward Multi-Player and being autistic I do not do multi-player.  If MultiPlayer mode in Crysis 2 is badly glitched-up as single player it is not worth it.

Crysis 2 had lots of promise but very little of it was realized which is a shame because; Crysis 1 was an awesome start of what could have been a killer series.  I liked Crysis 2 but I wished I could have liked it a lot more.  the crippled Nanosuit, the weak guns, the repetitive story, and fetch this oops I forgot that, meet me here there and everywhere missions coupled with all powerful enemies just made for a boring game.  The FPS as a game of fetch this get that meet me here has been so over done it is time for something fresh because Crysis 2 was stale at the moment of conception and it appears the time leading to its birth did not improve the end product.","GILTCHY GAMEPLAY, STUPID UNINSPIRED STORY, CONFUSING",1373068800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The graphics are top notch, especially when there is weather involved. The models are lifelike though refs are still missing and there is no chain gang. The sideline players don't really move or show emotion either. These are little things but make a difference when looking at the game as a whole. The graphics definitely make you feel you are playing a next gen game.

However, I do not like the running game whatsoever, it is very hard to run as once you make a move for a hole to bust through there are three defenders there to tackle you. If you try to go around someone being blocked, they suddenly come free and tackle you. You need a strong offensive line in this game otherwise your running game will be non-existant. Even the AI of the computer when running isn't that impressive - no big games from any runners, including LT.

The whole madden iq system actually backfires - it is easy  to pass the tests (my iq was at 665) but then you play the first game and the game is a lot harder than the madden test - after my first game my iq dropped to 504 so obviously i wasn't really a 665. The game constantly adapts to you which is fun but at the same time I have played 20 games now and no matter who you face they play at your skill level, meaning you don't blow teams out - my biggest win has been by 4.

Fun game yes, gameplay, while much improved, leaves a lot to be desired. No progression in franchise mode makes pre-season and training activities a moot point. I put Favre on the Jets (he is on the legends roster and can be moved to free agency or you can download the roster update). He is rated 99 and is 25 years old so I can have him for like 15 years lol. I might keep him though because if I draft a QB there is no way for him to get better. If they patch this it would be good but for those who can't go online to play it is not fair.

That is a gaming mouse which I have come back to time and time again having tried various other mice.  On paper you're still getting 9 buttons, braided cables, modular weight adjustment, and a grocery list of pretty standard 'gaming' features but in practice it falls short.

First and foremost it's a fairly comfortable design to its credit.  Button placement aside it feels pretty good in my hand.  It's a little more overly ergonomic on the thumb side like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-MX-Revolution-Laser-Mouse/dp/B000HCT12O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech MX Revolution Laser Mouse</a>&nbsp;which I think makes for a nice little thumb nook without having to drag your thumb over your workspace.

With the full load of weight (27.6g versus the G9's 28g) it still feels a little too light for my tastes.  The chassis itself is quite a bit lighter apparently, more in line with the Razor products based on my experience with them.  The weight is also relegated to the upper back right as opposed to the bottom and centered weight compartment of the G9.  Coming off of heavy use of the G9 this feels weird, the heft of the mouse in motion doesn't feel centered or balanced as a result of the off-kilter placement.

Most importantly the buttons aren't in the greatest places.  You still get some core buttons in key locations such as the two left thumb buttons but the others feel a bit too awkward.  3-4 or them require a pretty deliberate effort to press which isn't what I'd call ideal for a gaming mouse.  Perhaps one of the things I miss the most in this design is the lack of a 3-way scroll wheel.

The software is fairly straightforward, I'd go as far as to say it's some of the better programming software I've used particularly by comparison to Logitech's SetPoint and some older Saitek programs.

One complaint I do have, that I put forth with a grain of salt and the addendum that it could be strictly my problem, is that this mouse doesn't cooperate with my sound drivers.  I can install the software without issues but plugging in the mouse makes all of my sound instantly crackly and robotic.  Super annoying but again it could just be my problem or one with a fairly reasonable solution, haven't got that far yet in my use of this mouse.

Ultimately this isn't my favorite mouse in this price range.  The G9 has come down in price quite a bit and there are certainly some good bargains to be had even if you don't want to get in to this price range.

Here we have minimal modifications designed to only rinse and repeat races so that you can complete the goals listed under each modification you make to the vehicle. There is no way of going above and beyond and creating your own unique vehicle that you can be proud of. That is what I believe made the Most Wanted and Underground Franchise so popular. You had tons of combinations for choice. On Most Wanted 2012 you dont.

2. Gameplay that is missing is, Drag Racing. That was one of my most favorite moments on Most Wanted and Underground. I don't know if due to hardware or Blu Ray limitations that they totally left out Police Chases on multiplayer mode.  Jeez if they would have added that the could have easily multiplied the user reviews from players themselves and gotten 5 stars. Crashing frequently will get annoying, I don't believe the best racers will ever go a moment without getting annoyed for crashing when they are trying to complete goals for each car, or online. Some cars you notice will take a couple hits more before the game considers it a crash. Get ready for alot of restarts because of how tight your going to have to learn to race and focus.

3. Multiplayer, just finished playing at 1:45am. I must say I am not happy with it. You got alot of Takedown and bashing and everyone going in 360's waiting for a timer that takes 1min 45sec or more to announce the next game. It could be a circuit race, stunt challenge, and team races....Stunt Challenges are weird as hell, and often have you repeating a jump over and over to best your last longest jump. I swear its repetitive and boring. Mostly everyone I've played with seemed confused on some stunt challenges. The marker would be placed on some high point and can be easily overlooked EVEN WHILE refering to the map and its location. It's just poor. We don't see that competitiveness that was so fierce on Hot Pursuit online, because online feels repetitive and like a chore.  And no inclusion of online Police chase battles is a disappointment. On that matter I wonder if the direction they took on Most Wanted was purposeful or due to hardware or Blu ray constraints.

Pro's

1. Graphically the game is incredibly detailed, and the vehicles are modeled so beautifully. The damage on these vehicle are as good as they are going to get. The rough Crashes you may take are so well done, and you notice no slow down when you get flipped violently. The games framerate is impeccable IMO. Police Vehicles are detailed as well and the Chargers look like beastly intimidating vehicles like in real life.

2. Gameplay on the single player campaign I'd rather stick to then online. Its focused and linear to a certain extent, requiring specific things and giving you parameters as to how to get 1st place. The problem is its not a linear storyline. Your given new races and goals for each vehicle you find. See yourself spending alot of time finding new cars and running the same type of races for each. Its not like NFS most wanted where you win money and you upgrade your vehicle or buy a new one to match up to the opponents. Does this type of Gameplay warrant the title ""Most Wanted""?...no it does not, and this will never be the most wanted so many are being duped into thinking when Criterion released their first trailer. Does the Gameplay work for this NFS Most Wanted? Yes it does, because its not a campaign your gonna hate but your going to ask ""why did they take this route"". Its got reflections of Hot Pursuit in small amounts, Burnout(the moments you go around corners and crash), and the beauty of Detailed NFS games. Its most thrilling and ramped up aspect are the Police Chases which Criterion has managed to make harder. The Officers on here are relentless. Even when you have gone to a cool down period your gonna need to keep moving and go off road, thru alleyways, or facilites...these guys will even start looking thru shortcuts or thru the areas your trying to hide out at. Slamming into roadblocks with SUV's will automatically register as a takedown for the police, but it doesnt mean your busted it just prolongs the effort for you to run away. Now that handy lil 180 we have been seeing on the trailer is there for the specific reason for these SUV roadblocks. Make a quick double back and start running. Now the police chasing you won't just ram into you when doubling back, I think its meant to show that the officers are trying to play safe on their end and avoid killing themselves. I don't believe officers would ram a fleeing vehicle head on if they know its doubling back at an insane speed, in real life, so you will notice the restraint till they are behind you again. Try hard, its intense. My first police chase today registered for 23mins long...thats how long it was. On Carbon I had to slow down at times or double back on purpose to make em drag out that long. The chases I give 5 stars. but the gameplay for the rest is a 3 at best. It's good to a point.

3. Controls are just too Hot Pursuitish for a City environment. And this insane braking was adapted that you're gonna have to get used to. L2 and Square handle the front and Back brakes respectively. So braking doesnt just stop the car with Square, you need to press both to use the brakes for all four tires and you will understand it was for the purpose of making those 180's...weird at first and questionable!, but you will get the hang of it and works out Ok.

I cant even give a recommendation for this game with sound confidence or sound negativity. It is just so unusual the route that EA allowed and Criterion allowed itself to take for this ""Most Wanted"" title. I'm disappointed to the fact that I can't even be as enthusiastic with this game as I was with Underground, Most Wanted, and Carbon. Elements from all three of these games are missing in NFSMW 2012. It is just a shame IMO for me not to feel good about this purchase. So I leave it up to you the buyer based on how I wrote my opinion...im 5 hours into this game and not really in the best spirits with it.

3.0,False,"12 6, 2011",A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B0053BQREE,T. Skylar,"For this year's edition game publisher THQ drops the Smackdown Vs Raw moniker in favor of the new and simpler ""WWE 12"" but it's still clearly a continuation of the franchise, and I can't say that there any drastic change except perhaps the controls. Each year there are things to like and things to hate about every WWE/Smackdown Vs Raw titles, rarely do we get perfect or near perfect games (Smackdown Here Comes The Pain and Smackdown Vs Raw 2006 both come to mind as excellent wrestling games) and WWE 12 is no different. It hits and misses in some departments but it's playable and offers some WWE fun.

I like the new controls, when I first heard of them I was skeptical and thought I would hate them. They're a little hard to figure out initially but as with any games it gets easier and now they've grown on me. They pretty much ditched the previous controls and now you use A for grapples, B for strikes etc. and for the most part the controls are just fine. I can appreciate that they were trying to mix up the gameplay a little, the old controls were working fine as they were I think there should have been the option of keeping the old controls at least. The only real problem in the gameplay is probably the AI level. On Road To Wrestlemania the AI can be pretty harsh on you at times and often it's very difficult to execute a reversal. Something about the reversals is just not right with WWE 12. To make things worse, sometimes the game will indicate the need to repeatedly press the A button to regain balance but 95% of the time it never works, no matter how many times you press A. The AI beat me plenty of times and I've had to replay some matches more than I would like to admit. It's ""challenging"" alright but also frustrating. Graphics are excellent this year and look better than ever. The superstars, their facial expressions, the arenas and the crowds...everything looks gorgeous.

I find most of the problems with the game to be in the Road To Wrestlemania mode. First off, everything is scripted, every match has been pre-determined. You can't lose technically, because the game won't let you continue past a match until you win it OR have the outcome pre-determined that you lost. It's all about wrestling until you either win or beat your opponent enough to press Y and then a cut scene sequence is launched and all you do is watch. While you're backstage you can't run or turn the camera which makes backstage play fairly mediocre. All you do is walk slowly until you get from point A to B (and most of the time it doesn't lead to anything interesting) and sometimes you have to guess where you need to go. The backstage fights however, are fun. You unlock a lot of the roster, different suits, titles etc through the completition of the mode. Add to this the mode isn't all that long; you go on for basically a few weeks per wrestler. I remember when story mode used to be about a year long, leading up to Wrestlemania and all the Pay-Per-View events.

 You get The Rock as a free downloadable character with the game already, but I feel roster isn't exactly WWE 12's strong point. There aren't as much wrestlers as I would've expected and not enough Legends and Divas unfortunately. THQ has announced some download packs for Wrestlers like Batista, Trish Stratus, Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley and Jerry Lawler but I feel that this is a cheap move from THQ's part and that they should have been included at least as unlockables. Why pay $59.99 and then have to pay extra for superstars that should have been included in the first place? Sad move by THQ. I've noticed that occasionally bugs will happen, but not the kind that freezes the game. It happened twice so far that an opponent performed an Irish Whip in the ring and sent me in a frozen motion in the crowd. One of these happened in an Elimination Chamber match.

I was certainly glad to see the WWE Universe mode again. In the past I would spend hours making my own scenarios in my head and executing them in WWE games. Maybe I'm one of the few who likes this mode but this helps justify my purchase of WWE 12. Create matches is still here and this year they've added create an Arena which is a very cool addition, you can build your own Arena to your liking. Create A Wrestler is for many one of the best aspects of the WWE series and it continues to be excellent here. For me, a lot of the fun is found in exhibition play with some friends defending titles and playing our favorite match types over and over. It never gets old.

The game is very fluid which is what THQ goes for, looks and feels fantastic, and it plays very much like a real wrestling match by which I mean you can interrupt finishers and grapples from another wrestler, you won't just stand there waiting like previous titles. For all its flaws, WWE 12 remains a fun and entertaining wrestling game. The in-ring action is spectacular at times and always appealing. It offers the most realistic possible WWE experience a video game can offer. It even has all the ""WWE Presents..."" before the PPVs adding to the realism factor. I also like the commentaries in this title. In retrospect if THQ offered a larger roster and didn't try to rip us off into buying wrestler ""packs"", had a better and longer Road To Wrestlemania it would've made WWE 12 a better game. For all its worth I'll give WWE 12 3-3.5/5 stars, I like the gameplay and I'll be playing and enjoying the game for some time but I think the average gamer and WWE fan should rent before buying this title at full price.",I have mixed feeling about WWE 12...,1323129600,20,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Surprisingly enough, what I expected to be as terrible turned out to be miles better than those aforementioned titles. However, That doesn't mean the game is really good. It has the potential to be fun, but there are a lot of issues that bog down the experience still.

The game is a 2D side-scroller/beat em up hybrid. You alternatively play as Hiro (with Baymax somewhat tagging along), GoGo, Fred, and Wasabi, and as such you go run and jump to the end of the level while dodging enemy attacks or, on many occasions, the game would block progression unless you kill a couple waves of them. One thing I'm glad the developers got right here is that it feels good to hit things! I love to beat the cra-I mean HECK out of robots, especially with Fred's dinosaur tail on his suit and GoGo's ability to hit and run. It's just a shame the game is otherwise rather run-of-the-mill, as the levels are arguably plain and lack variety. Sure you can take multiple pathways, and the graphics for these places aren't bad, but there's nothing unique about them.

The boss battles are a different story; I was tempted to give this game one-star solely because of just how ungodly brutal the first boss can be. I ended up having to pray that I could button-mash my way through without him having to inflict pain that much. The second boss is more fair, but it drags for longer than necessary. Oddly, the final boss is easy, and even has checkpoints!

Despite Game Mill constantly pushing out terrible games, it's nice to know they could get a studio to suck it up a bit and at least make something mediocre.

Star Ocean is a game that, with slightly better writing and development could have been one of the best games of the decade.  But it consistenly falls short.

Let's take a bit of a look.

The game is graphically beautiful.  Full appreciation is due to the artists and animators.  Not just for wandering around the vast multiworld universe that is the setting for the game, but fight animation is also lovingly detailed.  Everything is great except for facial expressions.  The characters are usually deadpan, and Reimi has a distant stare that is positively chilling.

The story is intricate. Edge and Reimi start out on Earth's attempt to find a colonizable world in order to save the human race from the ruin of a war torn planet.  They meet a number of different alien races enlist characters (you wind up playing 4 out of a set of eight characters).  Eventually they meet more villanous aliens, uncover a plot to end the universe and have to defeat an evil mastermind.  Initially the game is linear, but gradually non-linear elements (such as quests) are introduced and you will do a lot of planet hopping.  To some degree there's too much story.  The worst example is the infinitely long closing sequence, which is unavoidabe and unstoppable.

Interplayer relationships are interesting as the characters are all quite different.  Acting, however, is spotty.  The worst example here is the crisis Edge goes through when his actions result in the destruction of a planet.  Not his fault, but he spends endless hours whining and beating on himself (massively overacted) before he gets back on track

Gameplay itself is the real problem.  The characters are irritatingly difficult to steer, and the precise position needed to accomplish something can be quite elusive.  This can get on your nerves.  For all the complicated battle options most battles are repetitious and frankly, the bosses are too easy.  Or so they are until suddenly they get way to0 hard.

Battle trophy hunting is an important part of character building since you need enough trophies to remove the experience cap and get more than a small handful of things to say while killing mushrooms.  Some of these are a matter of pure luck(kill an opponent with exactly the right anount of damage)or really aren't much of a challenge (run away 20 times).  None of the other collectables are that hard to get, but they are easy to miss if you don't know that some place is about to be destroyed forever.  Which means you will have to play the game at least twice to get the accomplishments.  And while I don't mind playing the hack and slash endgame for hours on end, the last thing I want to do is live through Edge's tantrums again.

I have a number of other grumbles, but no doubt you have already figured out that this is a very playable game that simply doesn't live up to its potential.  It is a pleasant pass time though so I would recommend it anyway as a good value for the money.",One thing or another...,1242345600,44,,

Unfortunately, there are a lot of little things that will likely make the value of the subscription fee here questionable in a month or two, and even early on many will have issues with forced grouping.  Having actually purchased the headstart, I am having a blast - but take a star off of fun for the grouping issue, and two stars off of overall for the rule implementations, lack of PvP, and value proposition, leaving this at 4 fun/3 overall, or 3.5 stars.

With Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) having spawned literally tens of thousands of imitations at the top of the family tree of RPGs, MUDs, and MMORPGS, publisher Turbine has both the blessing of an eager audience and curse of a really tough comparison.  The good news is that they've done an enjoyable job of implementing the heart of the D&D experience, which is the dungeon crawl.  Unlike many MMORPGs, support classes like rogues are a requirement for almost all dungeons - there's no uber single class build here - and a well designed group and careful gameplay is a more important than any particular player, item, or spell.

However, the group aspect is double-edged.  Outside of the first 5 or 6 early dungeons (even less for certain weak combat classes), solo play simply doesn't work - meaning your entire gaming experience will depend on finding a suitable group or guild.  The support for this isn't bad, with ingame voice chat and being able to select exactly what you want in terms of a class and level in group search, but even players within a good guild can have significant waiting times while everyone gets ready.  Turbine could and should have come up with a way for solo players to do something to advance.  All adventure is instanced, which in this implementation makes sense but does mean like Guild Wars the only 'massive multiplayer' aspect of the MMORPG feel is when you're at the taverns.

D&D purists will probably not like the rule implementations either.  Monks, druids, and several races are left out as are any number of skills, but the biggest wildcard is adding 4 class and race 'enhancements' which provide benefits far above even the best feats (like +5 to all skills or +3 in a certain statistic).  Given how the game is set up, it doesn't really affect balance much - can't solo anyway - but between that and loot drops that rival the taj mahal (down a bit from beta, but not much), it does annoyingly throw traditional character builds out the window.  Why bother making an especially stout fighter with high constitution if you're going to get 25 free hit points from the start?

More significant is longer term viability.  Advancement is quick enough so the current level cap (10) was actually reached by any number of people in the 10 day beta.  This will shortly be raised to 12 and eventually to 20, but the real issue is the lack of any alternative to the dungeon crawl - PvP, crafting, or anything else - that encourages people to stick around to pay the $14.95 monthly fee.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm having more fun playing this now than any game in a long time.  The issue is that I can also easily see not playing this in 30 or 60 days from now, which is a real shame.

I was able to play Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and i loved it. I got Sonic the Hedgehog 2 about a year later and it was far greater than one esecially with Sonic's new ability to transform into Super Sonic. Unfortunately that was my last Sonic game and the Sega Genesis was my first and last Sega console. Since i got this game in 2003, i never played a single new Sonic game in 11 years since 1993. In an attempt to clean out my house i sold my Sega Genesis and brought Sonic Mega Collection to make up for my loss. Here's my review for the games on Sonic Mega Collection.
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG I: Sonic's first game. The graphics are exactly the same as the Sega Genesis. Still love it despite the fact that it is an old game and technologically less advanced compared to today's games. Robotnik makes his first appearance and begins the Sonic Vs. Robotnik rivalry.  5 stars
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG II: Tails makes his debut and Sonic acquires two new features. One, he now can use the spin dash and second, Super Sonic (once you collect all the chaos emeralds). Again still the same as the original. New way to obtain chaos emeralds.  5 stars
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG III: Knuckles makes his debut. Everything else is bacially the same except for new levels. new way to obtain chaos Emeralds which i find to be confusing and stupid.
5 stars
SONIC AND KNUCKLES: The worst game in the entire collection. Too long with no save feature making it annoying an tedious.  0 stars
SONIC SPINBALL: I hate pinball games. tried it but fell short several times.  0 stars
SONIC 3D BLAST: A great game. Graphics are awesome. Loved it.
5 stars.
ROBOTNIKS MEAN BEAN MACHINE: A good game. Similar to Dr. Mario. like it.  4 stars

Newberry,"When I first started playing this game I was like maybe this will be a kool game ,because it kinda reminds me of halo but I quickly learned its a weak copy of HALO2. Pariah tries to play like Halo2 but comes up way short. The controls are somewhat standard FPS controls,but they operate a little sticky. When you walk over enemies dropped riot shields ,your player will have a hard time of walking over it  &  there's just a general sense of stickiness to the walking in certain parts. Also when you brush up against a wall it seems like there's glue on them. Its not a very smooth game. You can upgrade your weapons by finding certain upgrade thingys and you can upgrade your weapon about 6 slots .I didn't notice a huge difference after upgrading them. By the end of the game I upgraded all of them except the last weapon titans fist which is not upgradable. The enemies all sidestep throughout the game ,It may be alittle harder then other FPS but you'll soon easily be taking them out. I beat the game in about 3 days on the third highest difficulty. The vehicles are very simular to Halo2's ,even the way you mount them is simular .But they just don't feel smooth as HALO2'S .The weapon on the jeep type vehicle( I forgot the name of it) ,its the one that shoots out what looks like two small exploding cannon balls,is seriously weak. It fires horribly and the enemy scooter type vehicles seem to take it out almost too easily. When your vehicle is on fire and about to explode ,instead of jumping out ,your player gets out very slowly like an old lady goin to church. Also when your player reloads the weapon it seems to take forever,its almost like he relishes in reloading ,all the while bullets are flyin over your head. La La La Im  gonna watch myself reload .I shot an enemy while he was in a scooter jet ski type thingy vehicle in the head about 5 times with the sniper zoomed in but he didn't even fall off,so I guess you cant take out the enemy and save the vehicle for yourself,you have to take himout by destroying the vehicle. There is a bug in this game that for some reason you instantly die for no apparent reason .I noticed that it happened when I just touched or walked by a regular barrel & even flammable barrels that have long since spawned out after exploding from being shot. The way the bullets come at you from the airship turret towards the end of the game(the ship you have to jump on) look like mid 1970's quality graphics. Its kinda weird seeing modern graphics with 1970's bullet fire. The music tries to copy HALO2. The way the open areas are designed try to copy halo2 .I was very bored with this game it just doesnt play like a solid FPS.I only compare this game to HALO2 because its very obvious the developers where trying to copy HALO2. Everything from the music,the vehicles,the open type spaces and even the HUD are simular. Also when you  get shot your health will regenerate if it is not below a certain level just like HALO2 does. There are some good things about this game like the map editor. But I never bothered with it I was just happy to be done with the game after I rented it. Not a great FPS game.

I primarily use it to spin Pokestops, it does detect and spin them faster than I generally can manually (since sometimes they can take some time to load and be spin-able.) It is still subject to the speed limit, however I have had a few times I've seen it work when I thought it wouldn't, most of the time it doesn't any more than manually trying would work if you are in a car. It's very useful if you are at a place near a stop (or multiple stops) for a while since it will detect as soon as those have refreshed to spin again. As a recent note, it does get quests for you from Pokestops like normal.

Catching Pokmon seems to be of limited use unless you have a lot of basic Pokeballs and storage space to waste. You don't have much control of you success or what you're getting. I had a fair catch rate when I tried one day while walking around in a high spawn area, but it wasn't that many Pokmon I would have wasted balls on normally. I didn't pay close enough attention to see how many got away, just that I had saved a lot of Pokeballs but still ran out pretty quickly.

One useful feature if you are looking at your phone while using it is it will show you what it is targeting with a large pink arrow.

At first it paired to my device well, but subsequently it has had a lot of issues. I find if you fully go into the settings menu and remove and re-add the device, it works a lot better than trying to activate it from the main screen. (Remember to make sure your Bluetooth is on, I usually shut it off when not using the Plus. The phone Bluetooth usually recognizes the device easily.)

I haven't used it long enough to comment on the battery life, I only fire it up when I know I'll be passing by stops I want to spin, otherwise I don't use it. I imagine it drains a lot faster if you are using it to catch Pokemon, since when I had that option on it was buzzing and flashing like crazy all the time. I feel like it flashes more times than really necessary, I think it flashes like 6 times when I feel 2-3 is sufficient. I wish there was a setting to adjust this. I do feel like it helps my phone battery since I can let the screen go dark in the battery saving mode.
(Update on battery life- I used it today and I suspect the battery is getting low, it's being worse about pairing and being weird when I press the button. I agree the battery life is less that I'd like considering I've been pretty casual in use.)

You can't do anything else with your phone (other than use Google Maps) from what I can tell, it will lose connection and flash red a bunch. This includes getting phone calls, which can be inconvenient to have it nagging you with a red flash while you are talking.","Useful, but limited.",1527638400,,,

This game has been delayed time and time again and was originally slated to be released on the PC, X-Box, and PS2.  The game is currently only going to be released on the PS2 although if I remember correctly there was a PC demo some time ago.

The game feels like equal parts of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gunstar-Heroes/dp/B00002SVOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gunstar Heroes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Einhander/dp/B00002STPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Einhander</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bouncer/dp/B000056SNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bouncer</a>.  The integration of melee combat and shooter features is done well but from a gameplay standpoint it's nothing completely original although it's certainly one of the better examples.  I like that you can level up your various abilities on your chosen character which adds enough variety to make it rise above a large number of run and gun games and it also allows for a certain amount of replay value by being able to try different leveling schemes with the 3 different characters.  The graphics are alright, they're good for this genre but again they aren't ground breaking by any means.  The graphics feel like a PS2 spin on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Einhander/dp/B00002STPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Einhander</a>&nbsp;from the PS1, which to me is a good thing.  There's plenty of levels and a decent amount of challenge, but ultimately this game suffers from the same replay issues that most shooters do and that's where this game really fails for me.  It's not like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/R-Type-Final/dp/B00017X22U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">R-Type Final</a>&nbsp;where there is a ton of unlockables that keep you playing it.  Shooters are a style of game that really starve for replayability because from the get go they really aren't that complex or involved.  After a couple of play throughs you will be done, again with the leveling up there is a little bit more calling you back but ultimately it isn't enough.  You can milk it a little bit more given that the multiplayer is pretty sweet but this game isn't going to get the mileage most other games are.

At $20 you really can't argue though, it's a pretty good buy, especially if you're a shooter fan.  Personally I would pick up R-Type final but this game has it's own charm to it and does provide some fun gameplay.","Pretty Cool, Finally",1178064000,3,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'},
3.0,False,"11 10, 2013",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B0016Q4UJE,Aiex Halo,"I was lucky in getting this game on Xbox360 when it first came out in late 2008.  I played it all the way through and bought all the DLC for it, and it was more Grand Theft Auto than Grand Theft Auto 4.  I wrote a review for the Xbox360 version years ago.

But recently, I decided to start re-buying all my console games for PC, and by now, Saints Row 2 was on very big Steam sale.

I know how console games ported to PC tend to have problems, and I played the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4 before this game.  It went well enough, despite having uncomfortable controls (even by console game standards) and graphical issues.  By comparison, Saints Row 2 fully lives up to the problems in porting that are ascribed to it.

Where the console version was polished up and pretty, a true sequel to the sort of manic gang-land warfare that we left in colorful GTA San Andreas, the PC version looks and feels more like a ROM version of the game on an emulator not properly set up for this game.

The graphics are somehow flatter than in the console version; colors are less vibrant and shiny, oftentimes very blurry in order to hide certain glitches and limitations.  Despite the fact that my computer is top of the line for gaming, and can run more graphically intensive games even more smoothly than this one, I often get stuttering and sudden FPS drops, exacerbated when driving around to new areas.

The controls are standard for keyboard and mouse, but if you plan on using a gamepad controller, the game will not show button prompts as buttons of any kind, but remain keyboard buttons (as in, showing ""E"" for use, instead of your controller button), and setting the controls for the gamepad's analog sticks is almost entirely a trial and error method for determining which setting does what for cameras and movements, because by default, the movement and cameras are split between both sticks in a horrid configuration.

Even the sound has issues; it all sounds like it's been reduced in quality, to a very low sound quality in stereo, or a very high quality mono.  Even the PC port for GTA San Andreas (a game 3 years younger than SR2, and 7 years inferior in graphics) had better sound quality.

And the last biggest problem; no DLCs of any kind.  Whatever problems happened with the game developers and publishers, it means none of the DLC for the console versions have ever (or will ever) be released for the PC version.  And now that Saints Row 4 has come and gone, we're likely to never see the DLC for SR2 on PC ever.

About the only good thing about SR2 on PC is the modding, though there is little in selection out there now, save for one of the best and definitive modding efforts, called ""Gentlemen of the Row"", which adds new stuff as well as fixing many issues and bugs in the base game.","Great game, one of the worst PC ports I've seen",1384041600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The SteelSeries Stratus Wireless Gaming Controller for iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch certainly LOOKS like a standard multi-functional controller and there are a lot of things to like here.
1) Typical to -It has A/B/X/Y buttons, two thumb joysticks, and directional pad, four trigger buttons (R1/R2/L1/L2) on the front of the controller, as well as pause and power buttons.  The buttons all push down very easily and firmly and I like that the four shoulder buttons are textured so that your fingers don't slip and are sensitive enough that you can easily play games with out being so overly sensitive that a finger twitch makes you jump off a cliff or something.  Although the controller is pretty small, it fits easily in the palm of my hand, it isn't overly small (and I have long fingers).  Finally SteelSeries gives you a very nice smoked-plastic hard cover to protext the buttons on the joystick while its stowed away in a drawer or your backpack.

Syncing the unit was very easy.  Simply go into the Bluetooth section of your iPad/iPod/iPhone menu, turn the Stratus Gaming Controller on and push the sync button on the back and it will show up on the wireless equipment menu for you to turn on.  Charging is also very easy as it has a micro-USB port on the bottom of the controller and the unit has four LED lights showing its charge.  I fully charged the unit and then played games for an hour and it still showed 4 lights.  As far as games that are supported by the Stratus Wireless Gaming Controller, I count about 150 apps inclusing Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, The Walking Dead, Sonic, Pacman (and other classic Namco games), Call of Duty, C.H.A.O.S, Galaxy on Fire 2, and other.  Although this seems like alot, really that's probably a fraction of a percent of the total apps that are out there.

Now for the reasons that I only gave the unit 3 stars.
1) First, the thumb joysticks are completely worthless.  I played Pacman, Ms Pacman, and a couple other classic Namco games and when using either thumb joystick, I was continually either moving in the wrong direction or not changing direction at all.  I'd push up and either nothing would happen or I'd move right or left or even down.  So either my unit is SUPER sensitive such that you have to push the joystick EXACTLY up/down/left/right, or mine is busted.  So I ended up using the d-pad for all movement.  Thankfully it works great.
2) Also the four LEDs flash off and on continuously even when its synced correctly and fully charged (which the instructions say is the only time the lights should be continually flashing).  Needless to say, lights constantly flashing on top of the controller is very annoying.

Overall, this is a great little unit and I was super pumped to try it out and review it.  However, the fact that the two joysticks are less than useful as well as the annoying continually flashing lights, make the unit much less functional than it appears.  And honestly, this is a crying shame - I so wanted it to be better.

********************
Update (11 April, 2014)
I contacted SteelSeries about the issues I was seeing with the thumb joysticks and was unequivocally told that ""this was not normal and that there was clearly something wrong with my product"".  I was then, through some confusion on the part of SteelSeries about whether I purchased the joypad, directed on how to return the item and claim a replacement.  However, it gave me a look into SteelSeries' customer service organization and needless to say, the process to get a replacement is... cumbersome.  First there are all kinds of information you have to fill out on their website including dialoguing with their customer service techs.  Then ""YOU"" need to pay to mail your gamepad to SteelSeries so that they can examine the unit and determine whether the issue you are seeing is a defect or was just customer abuse.  Then if they determine that you are eligible for a replacement, they'll mail it to you.  I'm not sure what they do with the gamepads that ""aren't elible for replacement"".  This mail and return process is supposed to take 2 weeks.  Since I did not purchase the game controller, and thus had no ""proof of purchase"" that is required to start the replacement process, I didn't pursue this option, but I'd have to think that my controller would be completely inoperable before I'd pay $5 to mail it to a company with the ""CHANCE"" of getting a new one.  It appears to me that SteelSeries has setup a customer service process that essentially discourages claims through them as it is 100X more easier to just return a defective unit back at the store where you bought it - and paying MORE to get that replacement for a product that you are already upset about it not working correctly is completely counter-intuitive.","A Nice Idea, But Somewhat Fails During Use",1396310400,39,,

These three games (this one, ""Populous: The Beginning"" and ""Dungeon Keeper 2"", all from British company Bullfrog) all use a similar (spectacular) graphics engine and all fall roughly into the ""real-time strategy"" category. There is a marvellous aesthetic sense which pervades each of them.

In STP/TPW, a sequel to 1994's ""Theme Park"", you lay down paths and theme park attractions, then open your gates to an ever-growing throng of youngsters eager to buy your burgers and fries right before going on a loop-the-loop 100mph roller coaster. (Vomit figures heavily into your equations.)

Rather oddly for a theme park sim (though absolutely typical for RTS) you hire researchers who research advanced rides for you--not to mention advanced concepts like ""the gift shop"" or ""the restaurant"". With the right balance of attractions and staff and financial savvy you can change your! park from a travelling-carny level experience to a nigh-DisneyWorld extravagazna.

Well, sort of. Each of the four parks has a specific theme and must stay within that theme. No Disneyland style division (Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, etc.) in a single park. Understandable given the strain that would put on the hardware--but unfortunate.

Like the other games in the Bullfrog trilogy, there is considerable ""well, that's cool"" factor. And Bullfrog created a ""downloadable ride"" patch which theoretically could give the product some real legs.

But there is even less actual =game= here than in the other two. And after you finish your first park, you'll find that you're playing the exact same game on your second park. And third. Every park has the same number and type of rides, sideshows, refreshment stands and miscellaneous objects.

Playing is not unlike eating a huge cone of cotton candy: Sweet, but not particularly satisfying.

It's also a good exa! mple of a product at cross-purposes with itself. There's considerable ""toy"" value in the game: It's a pleasure to build your park. Typical of Bullfrog games, the interface is clean, simple and rewarding. Experiencing the game from the first person is a real treat. But.

Every moment you take to smell the 50-ft. high artificial roses (Wonderland park) is a moment where something is going wrong in your park. This is where the ""gameplay"" comes in, unfortunately.

When you have grown your park to a good size, you'll be stopping whatever you're doing every minute or so to schedule repairs. Now, there's a simple rule: You don't run rides in the red, so you check your maintenance report and shut-down any rides that are going from yellow to red.

Thing is, it's so mechanical, it would've been easier to just set a bar for the point at which the mechanics would go repair things. They could shut the rides down when they got there. (The way it works now is you have to s! hut the ride down and wait for a mechanic to show up, or drop one there.)

This is true of the rest of the staff, too. They wander around their patrol areas, one presumes, because they don't have access to your big park map showing all the problem spots. And you can't stagger their break/work times, so they can all be waiting for an opening in the staff break-room while your park goes to heck.

If Bullfrog had taken that out, though, there wouldn't have been much left to do except adjust the amount of fries on the salt. And, typical of the implementation of ""business simulation"", you have to adjust each stand individually as you build it (or flip back to a stand that has the settings you want and click the global setting button).

There's the cross-purpose: Trying to make a business simulation out of it. Building a park at the micro-level is fun--managing it at that level is a chore.

If they had gone the other way with the business simulation and allo! wed you to handle things like promotions, suppliers, unions, and lawyers, one of your pleasures could have been taking a break from it all to go to the park. (But that wouldn't really fit neatly into the categories that all games Must Now Belong.)

Anyway, it's hard to actually dislike such a good-natured, easy-to-play game and there's a lot of fun here despite the flaws. Hence, three stars.",More Fun From Bullfrog,968803200,2,,

3.0,False,"06 3, 2009",AWDIIREVRB6BI,B00166N6SA,Collector,"If you are going into Sims 3 thinking of it as an improved Sims 2 you will be disappointed.

The Sims 3 is a ""Sims Type Game"". It's like the previous Sim games but not quite. Sims 2 was about creating your own storyline. Sims 3 is about rolling with the punches. The game will change things in the neighborhood at random. People will die, move out, have children...the neighborhood is constantly changing. Like someone else said, the game is rather like an RPG. If you liked having complete control like in Sims 2 then you may not like this game.

Also, if you did not know. With Story Progression mode on Sims will leave town. Meaning they will disappear. Not only townies, your custom made Sims can be randomly deleted. It is not a glitch. It is an actual feature of the game. It's difficult to understand why EA thought having Sims randomly deleted was a good idea, but it's there.

There is an option to turn off Story Progression which is supposed to stop life changing events. Unfortunately this button does not work. Story Progression being such an important part of Sims 3, you have to wonder how this got by EA quality control. To me this is unexcusable. Fans have every right to be angry about this. Even before the game released this was a widely known problem. Everybody expects bugs, but for an important feature of the game to outright not work is ridiculous.

Next, the controls. Sims 3 controls: Clumsy. In Sims 2 the controls are simple, friendly, and easy to use. Sims 3 controls are strangely clunky and makes you jump through alot of hoops for something as simple as switching families. Get ready to learn the new and sometimes confusing interface.

Onto the Sims looks. Even after watching all of the promotional videos I did not realize the Sims 3 Sims were quite so chubby. There are ways to slim down the face in CAS but once you actually start playing them they look chubby again. After many hours of playing I have actually grown accustomed to their looks so it doesn't bother me as much now. If looks are very important to you this maybe a dealbreaker.

The Camera. Camera movement is not as smooth as in TS2. It's very touchy and jumpy. After getting used to the controls I'm getting better at using it but at the same time it lacks the smoothness of Sims 2. This is not because of my computer. My computer way exceeds the minimum requirements for Sims 3. The game itself is just plain laggy. Some advice for those frustrated with the right click screen drag, go into options and enable edge scrolling this will alleviate some of your frustration.

Onto the Pros!
The seamless neighborhood is gorgeous. This is one thing EA got right. I almost never left home in TS2. In TS3 going into town is one of my favorite things about the game. The scenery is beautiful. Go to the beach and lookout onto the water, it's moving, glimmering, and looks so alive.
I built my Sim home right next to a waterfall. Beautiful!

Traits system. I really enjoy the traits system. You can now make truly unique personalities. The little personality quirks of my Sims make me smile. Like if you have a neurotic Sim, they will want to check the sink constantly to make sure it's not dirty. A loner Sim will become upset at being around other Sims. An insane Sim will talk to himself.

Color Options. I love being able to give my Sims crazy colored hair and eyes. You can also recolor almost anything.

Improved AI. It's not obvious, but I do think the Sims are more intelligent in Sims 3. They are better at doing things by themselves. Frustratingly they still do the footstomp when their route is blocked.

Overall it's an entertaining game similar to The Sims games. But I am disappointed by the number of technical issues the game has. My advice to Sim fans is DO NOT uninstall Sims 2. I'm very glad I did not uninstall TS2. There are things TS2 still does better. It's much simpler and easier to play. I will be going back and forth between TS2 and TS3, enjoying the similarities and the differences.

EDIT: Hi I just wanted stress one thing. What EA did with The Sims 3 was take away creative control from the player. This is what made so many fans angry. I'm sure the anger will simmer down over time but the overall disappointment and missed potential will remain. The Sims 2 was about playing GOD. It is an integral part of what made The Sims so successful and loved. For EA to have taken that away from the player is a blow to a large group of The Sims fanbase. Now, it's still possible they will add more controls in future expansion packs so I'm not giving up on this game yet. It has a lot of potential and I would like EA to use it to it's fullest.",A Sims Type Game,1243987200,414,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},
3.0,False,"03 14, 2006",A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC,B000B659FE,Ethan D Van Vorst,"Back in the early 90's Disney released an obscure little gem of a game called ""Stunt Island"". The point of that game was to become a movie director on a fictitious ""stunt"" island off the coast of California and make movies of intense stunts. After shooting the primary footage you would then dissect the film in editing and eventually add special effects and music to make your film more complete. Ultimately you could construct gigantic 20 minute epics in cinematic VGA glory. Disney's ""Stunt Island"" enjoys a small, but devoted cult following to this day for the immense amount of latitude it allowed the player in crafting thier own home-made cinematic marvels. Until now there has not been another game like it, or even one that bothered attempting giving a player a shot at making computer-movies.

The Movies is a great, fun, and addictive game. From the get-go you will be drawn into the game, incapable of pulling yourself away for hours at a time. You are basically given the task of studio owner/producer, and it is up to you to hire Directors, Actors, and a number of Extras and Crew. When you begin your movie business in the 1920's you have only a very limited number and type of sets, including basic Western locations, and a couple of Flash Gordon-stylized Sci-Fi set pieces with which to work on.

There are 6 categories of movies you can make; Sci-Fi, Horror, Comedy, Drama, Action, and Romance. The trick to making high-profit films in ""The Movies"" is to listen to the radio announcer spout off the headlines. World events such as wars will put Action films in high demand. The Great Depression in the 30's will put high emphasis on making Comedies, while the Cold War space race of the 50's and 60's will pay off for those wanting to produce Sci-Fi movies. Making movies that are not in demand will get you a *much* smaller profit, so watch the news ticker often!

The movies will hastily slap together short 30 second pieces for the public, and afterwards give critical reviews and show the income the movie has made (these computer made flicks make no sense when you view them, but the public doesn't seem to notice). As the game progresses you will get the ability to make your own movies (more on that later). Based upon how your movies do at the box office every 5 years an Academy-like Award ceremony is held and distributes prizes to different film companies based upon said films. Getting an award will give your studio a sort of ""perk"", for instance getting Best Film award will grant a nullification of all your actors whining and complaining, as well as any addictions they may have. Obviously something to shoot for since keeping a steadying hand on your actors is an *extremely* time-consuming process, which snowballs nicely into my first real problem with the game.

Dealing with the actors is just plain annoying. Things start out civil enough. After being hired (watch the stats on each potential actor closely, and always shoot for the ones that are most patient and have the highest resistance to addiction) actors and actresses can reliably be counted on to make several movies with no major problems, however after the 5 movie-count they begin systematically caterwauling about pay, living accomodations, the clothes they wear, how much time they get to spend practicing, etc. In addition it seems pre-ordained that each actor is going to sink deep into the miasma of addiction of one form or another at some point in their careers, be it food or booze. Giving your actors nice trailers to live in helps, but there's precious little that will stem the flow of whining you'll hear on a regular basis. And there will be times when you'll just want to fire the whole lot of them.

Back to the meat and potatoes of the game, which is producing the movies themselves. If the player wishes they can construct their own movies utilizing a wide variety of sets and costumes. Said player-made movies are essentially put-together by linking a series of pre-made ""scenes"" and sliding your actors into pre-determined roles within each scene. For instance, constructing a movie based around a simple car chase can involve selecting up to 20 pre-made scenarios and sliding your chosen actors into the right, or closest to right positions within each scene. Due to the limited amount of scenarios they have included in the game your home movies may appear fragmentary and occasionally filled with ""bloopers"" (characters change positions on the set, a character may start out holding a machine gun, and in the next scene may be holding a pistol instead, etc). This particular nuance of the game is very difficult to describe to someone who hasn't played, however there will be, I suspect, a lot of nods of agreement from people who have played regarding  the problems I'm trying to describe.

The Premier Edition, which I am reviewing, only adds a couple of different costumes and hairstyles to the mix. Worth the extra few bucks? I would tend to say that any chance to add to this game is probably worth it, no matter how small. Remember, the more control/options you have at your disposal, the better your movies will be.

A serious ommission from the game is the ability to design your own scenarios or scenes, by placing characters onto sets where *you* want them to be, rather than predetermined by the game. This would fix a great deal of issues with making one's own movies. Another item that would have been extremely useful would be to have a model-shop, so that we could get exterior shots of all those fanciful Sci-Fi sets, see extra-vehicular combat that would bring the actor's actions more into focus. For instance, you can shoot a large number of scenes on a generic Star Trek bridge setting. The actors can have lots of dialog with each other, action sequences of them shooting each other, and even staged ship movement sequences as though the ship was just hit by a meteor or another ship (your generic Captain Kirk flying over a railing, after being ""hit"" by another ship). However because the program doesn't allow you to cut to an external scene of these actions the player must basically resort to method acting by the principals to bring about the idea of what is going on.

Once you've made a movie you like you can export it to Window's Media Player and send it to friends. I made several movies about my shy, soft-spoken librarian fiance in which she suddenly becomes a Kung-Fu hero, systematically wiping out a clan of giant Easter-colored chickens who stalk her from place to place, complete with music and special effects. Needless to say they were a huge, huge hit and were popular with her family especially. The game itself is great for home-made movies, but there is only a limited number of things one can do with the exisiting program.

The game is addictive (amazingly so) for the period of about 2-3 weeks, after which you'll simply have picked up the limitations of the game and will only occasionally play it. This is not irreparable, however. Activision can *easily* fix this by releasing an add-on game which would give players more control of scene setup and perhaps even a model shop (or CGI agency) where aerial dogfights, tank battles, and space battles could be designed and made. In addition some serious tweaking needs to be made to the Actor's behavior models as well. If you reduce their whining the overall gameplay and fun would increase dramatically.

Very, very fun game and a worthwhile experience, but it still needs some fixes on behavior patterns, and more player control needs to be added. Still, major kudos to Activision for having the guts to try a game as complex as this one is in the first place!","Great, Fun Game....For Two Weeks",1142294400,28,,

What people need to realize is that even the Sims 1, 2, and 3 were kinda bare when those first came out before they improved them with expansions and stuff packs. The Sims 4 is a base game, it's all new; new concept, new emotions, new gameplay, they are essentially starting from scratch with this game. Its like this, people complained about the lag, the hiccups, the crash to desktops, the glitches, and so forth with the Sims 2 & 3. In order to make the game run smoother EA unfortunately had to make some changes like loading screens, and smaller worlds. Sadly omitting toddlers, pools, vehicles, and open worlds is just unfortunately some of the things they had to remove. Eventually they will bring back some key features, and hopefully unique features never seen before in any Sim game. A true fan sticks by their product no matter what, and I plan to do just that. I have been a fan of the Sims franchise since the original Sims came out, and I am not going to let a few missing features run me off. I give the Sims 4, three stars because I can truly see potential even when others cannot. Most of the reviews are done by those who've only played an hour or less, sorry but how can one form a real honest opinion by only playing an hour? I've been playing since the moment of release, and I'm hooked! Of course I miss toddlers, pools, vehicles, etc. who wouldn't? but once I started playing it didn't really bother me much or negatively hinder my gameplay at all.

After the last Dragon Knight is slain by your coterie, you're tasked by a rogue wizard to stop Damian of the Black Ring. The storyline itself is a rather nice plot line involving a healthy dose of misdirection and how easily past history is rewritten.

The graphics are bizarre. While they aren't bad per se, some portions were so poorly thought out and implemented that you can't help but laugh when you see them. Doors are all ten feet tall, and some of the dressers and chests are the size of small houses, making you feel like you've wandered onto a partial set of Alice in Wonderland.

Audio is pretty good. Many of the characters are voiced, and voiced well, but between the scottish and irish accents, there's precious little in the way of original sounding characters. In addition, many appear to have some form of tourette's syndrome, and gesticulate wildly during normal conversation

Gameplay is fairly standard and straightforward. Four normal classes, melee, ranged and magic (offensive and defensive/summoing) all have effective compliments, but a majority of the time you'll find yourself playing melee, since you start with precious little mana. Difficulty does vary wildly, and youhave to be very preceptive to avoid wandering into a region with mobs twice your level and slain in 2-3 hits. Side quests are the standard compliment of find this, kill that, or talk to him. Between a few morality issue quests and some that deal with the perception of the universally hated Dragon Knights, there are some that have a nice philosophical ring to them. Additionally, if you find yourself bored with a quest and wanting to complete it as expidiently as possible, you can simply mind read your target and been done with in minutes, though this costs a sizable chunk of XP. This ability does have some long term benefit, but unfortuanetly, the appropriate targets may as well have glowing signs above their heads, so you'll just find yourself saving prior to use to see if theres any benefit.

Nits abound. Levers, buttons, and other interactable items are well disguised as part of the environment. Barrels, baskets, and virtually every other container has to be looked at directly to see if any contain items, meaning you have a rather frustrating scan to do if you're treasure hunting. Doors require keys, but carrying multiple keys, you don't have any indication whether you might have the key for the door, and said keys are almost 2D, laying so flat on tables taht you can't spot them without looking from directly overhead. Some quest battles are well above your level, forcing you to mob and side quest to be able to advance, and some random mobs will butcher you like a piece of meat. Icons above targets you should talk to are almost invisible, making quest NPC's blend in with the crowd, and many wander, leaving you to search throguh town. Autosaves are seemingly random, and you'll assuming there was one and find yourself sadly mistaken.

While some of the features, namely the mindreading are neat, most of the side quests and sub plots feel generic and overly done, and many add-ons feel almost vestigial. The Dragon form you eventually receive is a nice deviation from the norm, and a pleasant break in the grinding that somewhat plagues the beginning of the game.

3.0,True,"04 24, 2010",A2ZBE6HMAH83QK,B001NX6GBK,db,"Dante's Inferno seemed like a bad idea to me until I realized that the poem its based on is about as much myth as the Greek gods are, which makes it about as good idea as Kratos going on a warpath for and against varying gods.  That said, this game is not nearly as much fun.  The God of War series is always pushing the boundaries on what they do within the framework/gameplay of their genre, but this game seems to be treading water, always just above the line saying, ""See, I'm as great as Kratos, honest!""

However, excepting a pointlessly annoying room of portals, this game is significantly easier and shorter.  I found myself passing through Circles of Hell rapidly.  Limbo was over before I knew it, Lust gone like a snap, etc.  However, for what its worth, the game does give you a good sense of being in a stylized hell.  At least at first.  It gives you a fair number of demons to kill and, if you're into that sort of thing, monsters that well represent the sins they've committed.

Is the game fun?  Sure, for the most part.  Is it worth $60?  No.  Is it worth $50?  Nope.  40?  No.  30 or even 20 is getting closer just based on how short the game really is and how much more you get from the same gameplay in God of War 3.  Anyone who doesn't have a PS3 would be better off saving the money toward this for a PS3 imo due to how awesome an experience God of War 3, Uncharted 2, Heavy Rain, and Ratchet and Clank are.  Those games alone will be a large return on your investment.  That said, if you've some reason you're totally against a Sony system, then Dante's Inferno will be the only Kratos-like experience for you and I suppose you might enjoy it in that context.  But know its a pale imitation of the awesome original.

(Be aware that you'll encounter a puzzle room with portals that you must interact with to move forward.  It is in stark contrast to the rest of the game in that it can be very frustrating, depending.  For my take, I'd say it was an annoying change of pace that I did not appreciate, but it did not surprise me because an IGN review had already remarked that it existed and it was annoying.  I concur with the opinion.)

Graphics are fairly good, the audio is suitably creepy.  The cinematics are a mix of animated, computer-generated, and in-game.  They all work for me.  The animated work toward showing scenes from the distant past generally (like tales), the computer generated show hyper-realized moments of the present or near past (memories or regrets), and ingame shows the immediate now.  It all worked for me, I didn't have any problems there.  However, be aware that for a saintly woman, Dante's woman loves to show off her buxom quality.  I can't say I minded, but you might.  Also, unsurprisingly the Circle of Lust had perhaps the longest breast shot in the history of gaming as a boss uses her assets to her advantage.  Be warned.

Controls work well, most of the time.  You get a talent system similar to Diablo or Warcraft series to go along with the Kratos-like gameplay, so you can build up your holy or unholy powers.  Holy powers are built around the Cross weapon you have that fires crosses either at your enemies on the ground or in the air.  Its reasonably powerful and some of the powerups are pretty awesome with it.  Or you can boost your Unholy powers which are centrally based around your scythe, the primary weapon.  With many enemies, just before death, you have the choice to absolve or punish them.  Punishing them is killing them, absolving them is using the cross to disintegrate them into a holy light.  God apparently forgives someone after they've been beaten to death (despite already being dead) by a scythe.  Absolving gives Holy points that build up your Holy tree so you can access abilities higher up the tree; punishing gives unholy points that builds up your unholy tree.  Its an interesting mechanic, at first, but absolving every baby demon by grabbing them and then rapidly pressing the button gets tiresome.  There is an item you can get by collecting things in the game to make absolve automatic.

Everything else is God of War-like.  Attack, jump, block, special attack.  Dodge.  Match button presses to buttons displayed on screen.  DDR for bosses.  Be sure you go onto Playstation Network and get the free extra 500 souls to give yourself a decent boost towards your first powers.

Regardless, its a good game.  But not great.  If you have a 360 and no PS3, its definitely worth playing.  If you have a PS3, its worth playing as long as you rent or don't pay too much (or find yourself able to sell it for enough to make it not an expensive investment).  Especially so if you've played every God of War and you're still itching for more, but games that came out around the same time are better.  Before you pay full price or anything approaching full price for Dante's Inferno, be sure you've already considered God of War Collection (two God of War games from the PS2 upscaled), God of War 3, Bayonetta for the 360 (the PS3 version was done by Sega and has serious flaws), and Darksiders because I think each of these gives a better value at the prices as of this review.",Dante's Inferno:  God of War Lite,1272067200,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

This is the first Ubisoft game I have purchased since Assassin's Creed Unity and this marks the last.

These idiots still haven't gotten their act together.  I feel like the entire development staff is filled with ""video game school"" dropouts.

The entire production is reminiscent of the online bug fare found in Unity.  Constant crashing, constant disconnects, etc.  The only improvement over Unity is the saved session state.  So if you do crash or get disconnected, if you promptly return to the game--your place is saved, barring the owner of the group doesn't remove you, if you were previous owner--the new owner can kick you.

It's another game riddled with glitches such as invisible walls that you cannot clear around corners, betraying lazy programming that couldn't bother with removing the invisible barriers that prevent the player from smoothly clearing a corner, which can be quite counterproductive in challenging missions while you're taking fire and spell the difference between success and failure.  The actual combat system is funky and counterintuitive.  A player might try to instinctively react to an incoming grenade by fleeing, while simultaneously indenting the right joystick to spring and move in a diagonal direction, let's use northwest for instance, and doing so results in a northeast direction of travel...toward the epicenter of the grenade explosion instead.

I'm no rookie gamer, most games with fluid combat systems let my hand-eye coordination shine but this is not one of those games, folks.

This game does have its qualities and is definitely worth playing for its unique and innovative offerings but the bugs make it a game that will stay shelved once something better comes along and coupled with the little replay value, in light of lack of something better to play right now is why this will remain a 3-star production.

My advice to prospective buyers is to wait 'til it falls to the $35 US-dollar price tag range.

But if you've played all of those and are looking for something to tide you over until the PS2 release of Resident Evil 4, then consider the often-overlooked 'Clock Tower 3'. Set in England, you play Alyssa (what is it about that name and the Survival Horror genre??), a fifteen year-old schoolgirl on the trail of her missing mother, travelling through time and reality and evading the unwanted attacks of a number of ghosts and serial killers.

GRAPHICS: 5

Beautiful big characters, gorgeous scenery and excellent design make this one a pleasure to watch. Some of the lowlier ghosts are a bit chintzy (but after all, they can be dispersed with a ""Sentimental Item"", so what was I expecting??) and the overall visual impression lacks a Horror-style punch, but what the game does, it does very well.

SOUND: 3

Average music and average sound effects provide the backdrop for some of the most outlandishly bad voice acting in a video game. Ever. Remember Resident Evil 1? ""It's. A. Monster. Run. "". This is worse. Cheesy and OTT with no effort given to atmosphere, this really does drag the game atmosphere right down.

PLAYABILITY: 4

There are no weapons and no means of killing your pursuers until the actual boss battle, so running and hiding and using pre-set 'Evade' points is a very fun way of keeping Alyssa alive. Also this adds to the tension like nothing I've ever seen before. Simplistic controls and a really good camera system kae this one good fun to play, even if it does get a bit repetitive later on. Nothing to upgrade and plenty of special items means that there's no real challenge, though.

LASTING FACTOR: 2

This is a very short (4 hours and sixteen minutes first play, subsequent plays are less), very easy game. The final Boss is a b*stard to beat, and you need to keep every single special arrow you find in the game to even be in with a chance - he is unfairly tough, given the game's remedial difficulty levels. Replay value is low - though there is a replay mode, but it's not that different from the actual game.

OVERALL: 3

I hadn't played Madden religiously for a few years.

I was ready to dive back in. I wanted the Xbox version, but the friends that would actually
play on-line only owned PS3s. So I gave up the achievement love and got the PS3 version.

I was hesitant because last year's PS3 version ran at a slower frame rate.
I did some quick research and I didn't see reports of any differences this year.

Before I called my buddies up, I wanted to try a quick game. I jumped in and started playing like I never stopped playing. The game played almost exactly the same as 3 years ago. I had to get used to the hit stick and such, but it is still pretty much the exact same game. I'm not sure if I liked being good already, or if I wanted more of a learning curve. It was a little odd.

So I fired the PS3 up and that was when the problems started. The game only plays in 720p. My HDTV in my game room is a 40"" Sony that only displays 1080i, not 720p. I had thought that after the PS3 launch titles made this mistake, EA and Sony would have fixed the issue. Nope. So there I was, stuck playing in 480i in 4:3 mode on my TV. So the graphics were bland and I couldn't play in widescreen so I couldn't see the whole field. My wide out WRs were off screen.

The Xbox version will play in 1080i on my TV just fine.

I still decided to suck it up, because the only reason I got the PS3 version was to play with buddies who lived in other states.

This is where it got horrible.
The PS3 online experience vs. Xbox live is night and day.
The PS3 was horrible.
It took us forever to get a game going. There was some kind of glitch that kept changing both of our playbooks as we started the game to Chicago's playbook. Also, the only way we could start the damn game was to hit the X button exactly at the same time. We had to synchronize our button pushing. Literally saying to eachother , ""ready, one, two, three.hit X"". This was so stupid. But it was the only way we could get the game to start.

We had all kinds of problems with my ear piece going in and out. Not sure if it was a Sony thing or EA servers.

Once we got the game going, it was fun. My Raider's beat the Chargers :-)

I will never choose a PS3 version again. It just feels so unpolished.

Sorry, I haven't gotten to the Head Coach part of the package.
Also, I saw that the C.E. comes with a version of Madden '93 built in.

The game is very simple, meant for a younger crowd, hence why only released on Gamecube, but nevertheless fun to look at and play as a change for the usual hack and slash more violent games. The controls are easy to use, this game, unlike others in the GC make use of the B button constantly. Some areas require long distance jumps and in some places the camera dosen't do a good job of keeping the player focused on Hello Kitty whe she gets too close; she tends to get way too close or disappear briefly.

For wifi that requires you to login on a webpage (like a hotel or coffee shop or public ISP hotspot like At&t, Verizon and Comcast offer to subscribers), the Xbox 1 is a poor choice. If you try to open explorer without having a valid tested wifi connection first  you get a message that says you have to connect first and it takes you back to settings.  So that means no logging in on hotel wifi, no borrowing wifi from the coffee shop across the street, no using ISP hotspots. Comcast caps data in my area and the only other option is DSL and caps 50 gb lower. The caveat with Comcast is that they don't count data that goes through their public Xfinity hotspots in the cap. for all media streaming I have devices connected to the nearby Xfinity hotspot rather than my home wifi.  with Microsoft routinely releasing games that require a 10gb day 1 patch it pretty much limits not only downloaded games but also disk based games unless it can connect on the public wifi. 20gb updates and 50-60 gb  downloads really have to be off of a capped data system

With the Playstation 4  it was  a cinch: open settings, connect to Xfinity, switch to browser and login on Xfinity page. Done. Xbox CAN do it but only through MAC spoofing. Basically you have to go into the command line on your computer and enter a number of commands to ""spoof""  the Xbox's  MAC address on your computer temporarily, log in on the public wifi, accept whatever terms and conditions or enter a password,  Then disconnect from the wifi, change your computer's MAC address back to its original (make sure you write everything down) then connect your Xbox1. Hopefully the public wifi will think your Xbox is your computer and let it connect fully. If you're not super comfortable with command lines  Set aside an afternoon for the initial setup and mucking around and lookup more than one guide. I had some trial and error getting the right commands in terminal on OSX El Capitan because some of the commands had changed since the guides were written. Then just repeat that process every day or half-hour or whatever time period the public wifi you're trying to use limits sessions to.

It could be a constant source of frustration or never bother you at all depending on how much you have to use public wifi hotspots but the fact is it simply doesn't need to be that hard. If you use public wifi regularly I STRONGLY recommend against the Xbox1.
*******End Edit******************

As my first Xbox console I **was**  impressed with it so far. Ever since the 90's I've owned either Nintendo or Sony or both at the same time but never a Microsoft console. I already have a Wii U and a PS4 and this generation will be the first time I've owned consoles from all the major brands. So far I do think it's proven worthwhile to own both. If I had to choose just one right now I'd have a hard choice. Sunset overdrive Forza and Halo (from what I can tell having played through part of the Master Chief Collection) might be enough to make me say Xbox. That will probably change once Uncharted is out. Other than software there are 4 main things that stand out for me are: Controller, Interface Size and value.

Controller:
I really like the Xbox controller. Using disposable batteries out of the box is annoying but they do last much longer than the PS4 controller's builtin battery. Many have complained about the bumpers being too easy to hit. I actually like them a LOT. It solves the problem that I ran into a lot with playstation controllers where I end up using both index and middle fingers on the bumpers and triggers respectively and that's never been comfy. The Xbox layout makes it easy to reach both without ever moving your single index finger.

The haptic feedback in the triggers is also nice. One thing that I have to say I prefer on the PS4 is the touchpad on the controller. It makes it a lot easier to type in searches and messages.

Interface:
So far the interface is the weak point for me. I find it hard to visually identify which tile is for which thing since they all kind of have equal status. Finding settings took me forever. I'll get used to it though. Once I found what I was looking for I will say the layout is much easier to navigate rather than scrolling through endless lists of settings like on the PS4. Overall I prefer the the PS4 interface but that may be because I'm used to it.

Size:
This is also a weak point for me. I used to have both the Wii U and the PS4 occupying the space that the Xbox now takes up. It required to major re-wiring and shuffling to free up enough real estate for it on the entertainment center and now the TV and soundbar sit off to the side. Fortunately the PS4 stands up vertically and the Wii U is tiny so they fit nicely into other places but the setup is kind of ugly now.

Value:
Really, with all the price drops the Xbox is a sweet deal. For a 1TB PS4 bundle you're generally still looking at $30 more. Now that PS+ and xbox live gold are requirements I think that factors in more. I tend to find a lot more deals on Xbox Live gold memberships than I do on PS+ memberships- generally $30/ year for Xbox and $45/year for PS+ with some coupon hunting and deal alerts.

If you have a PS4 and are on the fence about owning both I don't think you'll regret it. Sunset Overdrive is AMAZING. Halo is amazing (even though I'm kinda tired of shooters) Halo 5 I'm sure will be great. I haven't tried Titanfall yet, but we'll see about that. Forza is amazing. Plus, with backwards compatibility there's a ton to play in the 360 catalog. I probably have more use for that than most since I never had a 360 but It's nice to be able to pop in to gamestop and pick up a half-dozen pre-owned games for cheap.",Excellent time to jump in and get access to Xbox titles,1445385600,,,

It feels less like a new chapter in the farcry saga, and more like an expansion pack to Farcry 4. Still, if you loved FC4, then great news: You're going to love this as well, because it's more of the same stuff! If you didn't care for FC4, I would advise against this.

Like previous Farcry games there isn't much in the way of a storyline. There's ""Something"" but it's not anything that's going to pull you in, however it's not supposed to be. The people who love Farcry don't love it for the gripping narrative. They play it because they enjoy the open world playground. Unfortunately for me that's not enough. I play games for the story, and this is sorely lacking. However, I didn't expect a story so I am not completely disappointed in that regard. I got it because....well.....Mammoths!

The voice acting seems to be fairly good, but be warned: The characters all speak Proto-Indo-European. What this means is that unless you are a freak and speak caveman language, you are going to be reading subtitles. This does add to the realism, but why does it need to be realistic when so much of it isn't realistic? I am sure many people will love the added touch, but for me it was an annoyance. I hate reading subtitles, because the text on the bottom pulls me out of whatever immersion I am in.

I do like the ability to tame animals and have them aid you during your journey. There are several animals you can tame, each with their own strengths and even abilities. You can even ride some of the animals later on as the game advances.

Overall, this isn't the worst Far Cry game around! It's still not great by my tastes, but it will be something I play off and on again when I get bored. Though, my interest is only due to the unique 10,000 BC setting of the game. If it was set in modern times, my interest would be non-existent.

I HATE first person perspective while driving.

the controls for looking at the map is terrible, I cant find anything!

I found the left joystick controls SOOOOOO awkward.  I adjusted the sensitivity but it just seems to move really slow to a point, and when the joystick is almost fully maxed to either left or right, the movement is sped up beyond control.  So there is the slow -to super fast feel while looking around the environment.  Makes it a b* to aim.

The AI is terrible.  People shooting at you from so far away that don't move, just stand there, you cant even tell where it is coming from half the time.  People shoot at you while driving before they can really tell who you are.  They seem really good at being able to hit you while your driving past them at 80 MPH too.

While I don't think it's as great or innovative as many people claim it to be,(the same company made a very similar game called Fahrenheit a few years before), it is not as bad as others claim either. It falls in between. What I love, is that it takes the interactive narrative format from Fahrenheit to a new high. The cinematic story actually changes depending on what you choose. One of the people you are controlling can die and that has repercussions on figuring out who the killer is in time. More than one actually. And you won't know which choice determines what development. You really see a movie unfold before you and which is governed by your choices not knowing there are a bunch of other ways things could have turned out. This is very special.
However, the execution is not always perfect. For an interactive story to work as a game, you need 2 things, a solid story and solid game mechanics and it falls short on both.
The story has many, many plot holes and certain events just do not make any sense. The origami killer seems omniscient and supernaturally quick and stealthy which hurts any sense of realism the game is trying to achieve. It also does not help that anyone with half a brain can figure stuff out faster than either of the two people investigating the murders. A clue will be staring them in the face and they just won't get it.
The other point to make is that the controls are not great. They are fine for quick time events but controlling your character's movements is sometimes very clumsy. Your character will sometimes wander off somewhere you never intended, or won't be prompted to use stairs or open a cupboard even though the character is aligned with the correct direction. There are also a few glitches here and there. I had to restart a checkpoint due to a series of prompts not appearing when they should have.

But for Sonic The Hedgehog 4, it is a attempt for gamers to master the hedgehog with his return to 2D speed. The game looks good, but yet doesn't feel as distinctive as the classic speed Sonic had years and years ago. The game does deliver through 6 worlds which Sonic can master with 4 leveled zones each, including a infamous boss battle with Dr. Robotnik.

3.0,True,"08 7, 2010",A5NW620UKE9K,B000O5FULU,DANN,"The game, like many other reviewers have noted, is marred by quality issues. When I first inserted the game into my PS3, it asked me to run an update, so I thought perhaps there had been an update put out that took care of some of the quality issues, but unfortunately that's not the case. The game was released in 2007 and despite this being 2010 the game still has the same problems with frame rate speed. I didn't notice this issue so much on the 1st level in Iraq but it was VERY noticeable during most of the rest of the game-play. I did get used to it, however, and a tip for you is when you see the word ""loading..."" come up on the screen, which it will often and at odd places during the game-play, just stop what you are doing. The game completely froze up on me twice, and I had to reboot it - fortunately I didn't lose anything. But I figured out that if you keep mashing the shoot button or the driving button, etc. while the game is trying to load it will at times cause it to freeze up completely.

Another issue is the driving mechanics for the vehicles. The only vehicle you drive is a Humvee, and it's only on a couple of stages. I typically like driving vehicles in games, it's a lot of fun when the controls are set up properly, but in this game it is by far the worst I've ever seen. It takes considerable time and counter-intuitiveness to keep the damn Humvee on the road!

Despite the games flaws, it is pretty fun to play. Though I did begin to find it quite unimaginative during the later stages of the game. Despite what you are facing, you are pretty much using the same weapons, or jumping on a turret and just mowing down aliens. This was fun in the early stages, but it gets boring after a few hours of game play. And you are basically facing the same aliens/mutants in the second half of the game that you faced in the first half.

The graphics are so-so, nothing that is really impressive, in fact it has more of a PS2 quality to it. But I found many of the environments very well done, though they  are not very interactive.

The sound quality is pretty bad. For some reason, at certain stages especially during a boss battle it seemed, the audio will sound as if it is coming out of one channel more strongly than another channel, so it sounds like the balance is out of whack.

I didn't really have a problem with the AI as some others have mentioned. But you can't really expect them to do the bulk of the fighting, they are support only. One of the combat techniques the game recommends is to let your team go in first, then you ""mop-up"" the rest. But on many stages this doesn't work - the team will take forever to kill something and die and have to respawn. It's much quicker if you just do the killing yourself! And use them as support.

This is probably the shortest play-time of this type of game I've ever played. I estimate it at about 7.5 hours of play time - I played for an average of 1 to 2 hours each night, and beat the game in 5 days. It's also one of the easiest games I've ever played (though I didn't try it on the hardest level) with the only real challenges being the helicopter that you must shoot down with a sniper rifle (about the midpoint of the game) and the final boss, but that one only took me 3 tries, so not really that hard.

Interestingly, the game didn't really remind me much of the Area 51 game that was made for the PS2 (I liked that game much better), this game reminded me more of the old SOCOM games, like SOCOM 3, though you are in FPS. This game has much more of a military-action/shooter feel to it, whereas the Area 51 game more of a Sci Fi feel to it. And your opponents in the game aren't really aliens, but rather mutants - you will understand as the story unfolds.

I'm being a little generous with the 3-stars and overall 6 stars out of 10. Without a doubt this is the most buggy game I've ever played. But despite the significant quality issues, the game is pretty decent overall and I will probably replay some of the early stages for fun.

Lets start with the story, the story was well made in a publishers or a writters point of view, but if you put it in action like this game was. Its horrible... The characters barely have any dialouge, Confusing reactions to certain scenes in the game, Ex (See's zombies and monsters for the first time and he plays it off like its nothing)... The story is there!! but it needs lots of polish and more emotion!!. Everyone in the game is so monotone its horrible. Its like playing the house of dead watching the corny and silly dialouge... With that aside the story makes sense and it was beautifully made, but the voice acting needed a lot more emotion...

Graphics: Man, you guys did such a great job at graphics you completely forgot about the gameplay. Only thing I can say about graphics is that you guys did a superb job when it comes to graphics..

Gameplay: Now the game play mechanics takes off from resident evil, its not to say its horrible but, it definately needs a lot more polishing. The Melee is absolutely pointless in the game other then breaking boxes, even if you blow off 30-40k for upgrading your melee you won't get any stronger. The upgrading system itself is pointless and tedius for you cant even have fun with one playthrough ( for a casual gamer) For me it wasn't as difficult but for begginers this gameplay is defantely one that is not reccomended for the easily irritated! lol... There are so many ways you can die here its ridiculous and the boss fights itself are tedious. and Why the heck are you so slow when your sneaking. it takes a solid 10 seconds to get a 3 feet in front of an enemy for a sneak kill. And! without a proper walkthrough you cant have fun with the weapons or skills. You'll be stuck sprinting for about 2 seconds? really now?! Because you have to i quote have to!. shoot these statues for goodies in the morgue. 5-9k points. and it comes in stacks.

All in all, The Evil within tried to be a good horror game but, it did not get my marker. Its not horrible, but its not great either. I admit, as you progress through the game it does get easier with better weapons and unlockables but this game needed a lot more creativity. I mean shotty gameplay mechanics in a survival horror is not a good combination. (As if your scared enough). They did a great job in terms of horror though I do admit that as well..

I wasn't a big fan of the original Burnout game.

It was too buggy, the car handling was lousy, the graphics were terrible and the sound was astonishingly bad. Because of that, I've skipped all the Burnout titles since then until I got hold of a copy of Burnout Legends for my PSP. Seeing the gameplay in there coerced me into getting hold of a copy of Burnout Revenge.

Changes... James Thottam

Some things have changed, some have stayed the same. The car handling is still lousy, but now it doesn't really matter. The brunt of the game is still the same as it ever was - drive badly to earn boost, use boost to win races, and win races to advance your skill level.

There are a few different types of event to compete in. The first is a straight race to the finish. Next up is road rage, where your objective is to ram your opponents off the road for points. Then there's Eliminator, where the last car in the race is eliminated at fixed time intervals. There's a new mode called Traffic Attack where the objective is to do as much damage as possible to all the other traffic. And finally there is crash mode, where the aim is to dump a car into a carefully crafted traffic scenario to do as much damage as possible.

In race, road rage and eliminator modes, you can earn boost by getting rid of opponents - forcing them into scenery or oncoming traffic for example (a takedown). But if they perform a takedown on you, their marker turns red and you have a revenge target (new to this game). Get your revenge on them with another takedown and you're awarded more boost and an after-race trophy. And here's where Burnout:Revenge has another nice feature. Each track has a ""to-do"" list associated with it. For example, three revenge takedowns in a race, or a vertical takedown from a specific ramp. Some of these you'll acquire during normal race time, but its a good way of adding longevity to the game. Suppose you've got gold in all the events. In most race games, your interest would likely wane after that point. Here though you can go back through the to-do lists and spend time at each track trying to fill in the blanks. It's worth noting that some of the initial events you can enter will be events you cannot win until you've worked your way through the game far enough to get a bigger or faster vehicle. When that happens, then you can go back and try those earlier events again.

The Need for Speed...Jameson Thottam

EA have done a great job of conveying speed in Burnout:Revenge. There's no popup in the distance and all the track details and other vehicles are beatifully rendered. You really do get a real sense of speed. The best change they've made to the game since earlier versions is to do with your continued ability to speed in-game. They've now made it so that any traffic going the same way as you is no longer an instant crash, but instead can be deflected and destroyed. This leads to a far smoother feeling of gameplay. Whilst it does remove the skill of dodging traffic (which a true race game would force you to do a lot of), the whole point of the Burnout games is mindless destruction. Allowing you to hit same-way traffic is a great way to enhance that part of the gameplay.

Some Nice Features... Jameson L Thottam

As with the previous title (which I didn't own but did play once), Burnout:Revenge has aftertouch and crashbreaker facilities. This came about in a post-Matrix world of wanting everything to use bullet-time. In Burnout, it's used well. Once you've crashed, you can steer your wreckage to a certain degree to inflict even more damage. And in the crash modes (as well as certain race modes later), if you do enough damage, you can then hit the crashbreaker which basically destroys what's left of your car with an explosion to do even more damage. The power of the crashbreaker is either dependant on the boost you had before crashing (in a race) or on your ability to mash the R2 button (in crash mode). Either way you get even more aftertouch once you've exploded and can go on to do even more damage.

The Established Mainstream... Jameson L Thottam

I think for that reason alone, mainstream manufacturers have been loathe to allow their vehicles to be used in Burnout games and the same is true here. You get generic EA-created vehicles with no brand name that don't even look like any car you might recognise on the street. This is a minus point for me. All the cars handle exactly the same apart from their top speed, and not having any brand names makes it difficult to distinguish one car from another. What's the difference between a Consolidated M185 and an Associated R23?

Design for the Go...  Jameson Thottam

The track design in Burnout:Revenge is pretty good. The draw distance is amazing for a PS2 with the all-pervading fog not coming in for at least a mile. This gives a far more ""wide-open"" feeling to some of the tracks, especially White Mountain. Most of the tracks have shortcuts now, indicated by flashing blue lights at the entry point, as well as hidden ramps that you can use to jump over opponents. (If you use a ramp and land on an opponent, you get a vertical takedown award).

The track designers have done a good job of figuring the points on each circuit where you'll be likely to run wide in a corner if you're mashing around on full boost. Typically, at those spots, there'll be a concrete pillar or some other immovable piece of scenery to bring an end to your shenanigans. It'll take a while to learn these gotchas and master the tracks.

The track locations are varied from a neon-lit metropolis to a leafy country backwater. The generic italian city is fun to race in with its narrow streets and towering old stone buildings.

Some Irritating things... James Thottam

There's a couple of irritants about the game which are worth mentioning. The first is the camera. You can't default it to be in-car - it always starts in the above-and-behind position. Honestly I don't know why any software house still uses this camera point in racing games. It was a fun, novelty piece of eye-candy when it first came out, but it's absolutely useless for driving. You have no concept of speed or direction, or proximity to other traffic or objects. So in Burnout Revenge, you have to hit the triangle button at the start of every event to get the proper view. This gets very tiresome after the first couple of times.

The second irritant is the changed perspective that is used to signify driving on boost. When you stab the boost button, the car speeds up but the game lengthens the perspective of your view which results in this weird zoom effect. It's not too bad going on boost, but when you run out and the car slows back down to regular speed, the view zooms back in and you will inevitably crash because from your perspective, it looks like you've suddenly shot violently out of control towards everything in front of you. I'm not sure why they've done this - the game conveys the feeling of speed just fine without it.

And finally there's the choice of music in the EA Trax (now a staple of all EA games?). It is terrible. No - that's not a bad enough word. It's dire. It's about 37 tracks of thrash metal, heavy metal, grunge metal, death metal, metal, rap metal, and every other type of metal music mixed in with 3 trance/dance/techno type tracks. Fortunately EA have had the presence of mind to allow you to choose which music you hear in the game so the first stop for me was to turn it all off and just make do with the sound effects.

Seriously - driving games to heavy metal music just aren't my thing. I don't like the music, I don't like the style and having to listen to it whilst trying to concentrate on a game is just mind-numbingly distracting.

For those three things, I knocked a star off my rating.

This is the last time I pre-purchase or buy a ""deluxe"" version of a game.  There are many immersion breaking bugs that mar a game I could really love and the fact that it barely plays at all on with a GTX 660 is disapointing as well.  While this game has all the things I love in a Bioware Game- fun story, interesting characters to interact with, solid action based gameplay, this game shouldn't have been released if they weren't finished debugging it  Parts of it feel a bit rushed.  There are a couple of parts where I feel the story contradicts itself a bit. Yes there are bad facial animation and some bad lip synching but honestly the other games had that too to a degree. I wouldn't have been so upset about the problems with the game if the game itself wasn't great fun.

Here's whats wrong for me

Companion Loyalty quests have problems.  Companion quests are often one of my favorite parts of Bioware's games.  Dracks quest was awesome and I wish I could have seen the course of the quests for 3 of the 6 companions.  Several of the companion characters have bugged loyalty quests that cause problems proceeding with quests or cause them to not trigger for many players.  For me I was unable to trigger Liam and Vetra's loyalty quests at all, Cora Loyalty quest stayed ""On Hold"" from an early point and I was unable to get it to proceed. Peebees quest can become impossible to progress if you bring Peebee with you while searching for a component on one of the planets.  Drack cannot be found for a while anywhere on your ship when you need to talk to him to progress his questline (he showed up on the map of the ship-he just wasn't there) Over time he appeared somewhere else on the ship and I was able to talk to him to trigger the rest of his quest. .  Jaal's Romance quest wouldn't proceed until I overheard him talking to his mother-on one of the planets( which should be a quest marker if that is required ) So I had some problems all 6 possible companion quest with 3 of the 6 impossible to complete

Companion Conversations not triggering.
As you drive around they are occasionally supposed to talk and I got very few-  Maybe 10 during the entire game. They were plenty chatty on the ship

Running bugs
Occasionally during combat or once just running around my character collapsed and would not move.  I had to restart the game from a previous save. I also would sometimes get stuck on rocks and would have to restart from an earlier save.

Facial animations
Other people have covered this better than I could.  Some are just plain weird.

The good.  Once they fix the bugs I think it will be a great game.  There were lots of fun characters and storylines.  Not as amazing as ME 1-3 but still a lot of fun.  It seemed like there were more conversations options with characters which I enjoyed in this game and more flirt options.  Multiplayer seems ok for me.  Bioware does seem to be working on the problem but I don't know if I'll bother to replay the game right now.",For PC users.

3.0,False,"01 7, 2009",A1KAERT0MPBZOO,B001DWK4NC,Arnim Zola,"This is my first gaming mouse. I've found the default Microsoft mouse that came with my PC (Wheel Mouse Optical) to be sufficient in the past. Overall, I've found the Sidewinder X5 to be clunky and awkward.

PROS
+ There are 2 thumb buttons to assign macros. This can be useful for actions such as 180 turns within games, etc.

+ On the fly DPI change. I've made a quick diagram (see user photos above) to illustrate the extra precision you can get by changing from 2000 DPI to 400 DPI. This would be great for precision shooting (e.g. sniper rifles) within a game.

CONS
- This mouse is bulky. I'm 6' with an above-average hand size. This reminds me of the larger, original Xbox controller that first shipped. If you remember, the more popular Xbox controller was the smaller S model released for Japan and then later released in the US.

- The placement of the 2 thumb buttons are awful. These are arranged with one above the other. My above-average thumb can easily press both buttons at once which is not the point. You want to only press one of them if at all. This means I have to use the tip of my thumb to press these buttons and also means I need to slide my hand further back from the front of the mouse.... Which means less control over the mouse direction.

- The thumb buttons are also too easy to accidentally press. As a test, I set the buttons to show my desktop. In the course of answering a few e-mails, I've accidentally jumped back to the desktop 5 times. So when you're playing a game, expect to see the thumb buttons triggered a lot by accident.

- The scroll wheel doesn't seem to work right for web browsing. It jumps down instead no matter how I configure it. Jumping is awkward for reading a page of text.

- Not for left-handed people.

I would recommend this for games if you set both of the thumb buttons to the same function. This would let you hold the mouse better since you wouldn't need to press the thumb buttons with the tip of your thumb anymore. When you're not playing a game, I'd recommend re-connecting your original mouse which is less bulky and awkward.",Useful but Awkward,1231286400,,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31EWIrfV+FL._SY88.jpg']

I bought this game immediately upon release, and was so thoroughly disgusted with it after 4 hours that I pronounced it DOA. Yet, in a strange twist of fate, I find myself playing this one again. In the end, it's hard to rate this game as a single entity. You really need to break it down into two components: the single-player campaign, and the multi-player pseudo-MMORPG that follows. So, that's exactly what I will do.

SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN

Man, this is terrible. This might rank as one of the worst single-player RPGs I've ever encountered. ""Rank"" is appropriate as a verb and adjective here. This game stinks.

GOOD:
-Graphics. A lot of people complained about the graphics. I'm not one of them. In fact, I prefer the colorful in-game graphics to the washed-out cutscenes. I wish more games would take a cue from this; not everything is about realism. I love the color, and the cute character designs.

BAD:
-Ummm, everything else? I mean, it's really easy to pick apart this game. Let's start with story. What a monumental bore. I couldn't care less about the chronicle of this White Knight. I'm even more disgusted with the stupidity of both the protagonists and the antagonists. Whose incompetence will ultimately win out? Well, you pretty much know the answer, but it's amazing to watch the cliches pile up. The only thing good is that the story mode takes around 15 hours, and that's assuming you're screwing around. Yes - it's a sad world when you are thankful for the end of a JRPG.

I mean, it's hard to describe how stupid this is. One moment, your party saves a princess from imminent death at the hands of a fat, moustachioed, idiotic villain. The next? Your party leaves said princess by herself, where she is subsequently kidnapped. I kid thee not. Characters are tired from the outset, and only get worse, as they chime in regarding your situation every five seconds. That's right - the single most annoying aspect of ""Rogue Galaxy"" rears its head again here. Expect to hear the same tired comments over and over as you press forward.

The environments are laughable. Repetition is everywhere in dungeon design. The cities might have been more interesting; after all, they are huge. However, of the hundred people with whom you can talk in each city, there might be three that actually tell you something related to the story. Mind you - I don't mean three people to push the story forward. Most conversation is of the variety, ""I want a horse, mommy!"" ""No, sorry."" It's cute when it appears once. When it is the norm, it's unbearable.

The game has a remarkably complex system in place for battle, requiring you to form combos, build character types, etc. None of it is necessary in the single-player mode. Battle is blindingly easy. I used the most basic ability (""slash"") on every one of my characters, and never lost a single battle. This is with NO GRINDING, mind you. I will confess that this system plays a crucial role in the multi-player madness that follows. it's a shame that the single-player mode doesn't even try to teach you its worth.

Speaking of gameplay, it is a monument to boredom. Battles are lame. Bosses are lame. you pretty much do nothing throughout the game, other than move from point A to point B(that's right - this is a really linear game). If this was all the disc offered, I would give this one star without thinking twice.

Multiplayer:
I don't know if the game ""shines"" here, but it is significantly better. You see, WKC was clearly not meant to be an SP experience. The MP mode is where the money's at, and it is really good. If you've played an MMO before, you'll know what to expect here. Lots of quests. Lots of customization. Lots of farming for items to build better weapons. You can join guilds, which improve over time. All in all, it's a fun experience. I would give it 4 stars, although unfortunately, the online community can put a damper on the experience. Getting some idiot kid to send you 100 messages calling you a ""noob"" can be frustrating, but at the same time, there are people out there who just like to play, and will help you along (and you'll need help to make sense of how to develop your character). If you like this sort of thing, you can get another 500-1000 hours of free play out of this one. That's great value. All in all, I would give the MP mode 4 stars.

The problem is, it's not the experience that was initially sold by the game. I have no doubt that a fan of MMOs will get a huge return for his investment here. However, plenty of people went into this thinking that there would be a rewarding single-player mode. It is not here. Seriously - the SP mode is so bad that this game isn't even worth twenty bucks if that's what you want. But if you are looking for a long MP experience, you won't do much better, and you could do a LOT worse. Buyer beware, but fans will get a lot out of this one.

3.0,False,"08 3, 2012",A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B005J5K9EI,Richard Baker,"The Good: Tons of visual flair and sex appeal, oozes style, lots of fun mini-games games and quick time events, fun boss fights

The Bad: Cumbersome and sluggish combat, only 6 levels, characters aren't as interesting as they could have been, not much reason to go back

Most of the time when a sexy protagonist is on the front cover you know you're in for a bad game. Lollipop Chainsaw is actually quite enjoyable if you look past the flaws. You play as the sexy cheerleader Juliet Starling who is part of a zombie hunting family. You must stop a goth kid from turning everyone in your high school and town into zombies. The story is pretty thin and not very interesting because the game isn't even long enough to dish out a meaty story. With only 6 levels you're looking at a weekend rental at best. With this being a Suda 51 game you can also expect crazy out the you-know-what. The game is oozing with style and visual eye candy, but is it any good?

The answer is yet, but with flaws. The first issue is the combat. There are plenty of combos you can buy and unlock at chop2shop.com stations. You can buy health and other items like art, threads, and music. Once you start unlocking more combos the game is more diverse, but Juliet doesn't feel like the limber cheerleader she should be. Basic attacks use her pom-poms, but it takes forever to make a zombie groggy enough for a chainsaw kill. I rarely used basic attacks and just stuck to chainsaw attacks. Her chainsaw is cumbersome, and the combat system in general needs more polish. I felt like I was controlling a giant fat guy rather than a nimble girl. Her animations are too long and you get constantly knocked back which means tapping B to recover every time. The combat is just sluggish and not as limber as games like Tomb Raider or Bayonetta.

The combat is even flawed with the chainsaw blaster. Aiming the thing is a pain because it always sticks to enemies like there's a magnet. I can't go for precise headshots or aim at barrels. You can use Nick Tickets which are special mini-games that use Nick's head (her headless boyfriend) as a weapon. These are pretty crazy and funny like shooting his head out of a cone like a topper or swinging him around on a rope among others. You can use your rainbow power to become invincible for a while and start sparkle hunting. If you kill three or more zombies in a row you will a trippy girly pose scene of Juliet and earn bonus coins.

The combat is obviously the main focus because there's not much else here. There are a few mini-games like pole dancing, jumping on zombie heads, and the few mini-games that are level specific, as well as a few chainsaw dash areas. The 6 levels are interesting and keep things mixed up, but it's the bosses that are all different and interesting. Each one has some sort of musical skill from a different genre of music. Having to kill them is awesome and full of gore and guts which you will see plenty of.

Lastly, the graphics are not technically impressive, but have lots of visual flair. The blood from zombies flows pink with rainbows, sparkles, and stars flying out. The game is very girly, but appeals to men due to the sex appeal and violence. Juliet herself is hard to like and is not as memorable as other females like Lara Croft or Bayonetta. She's a dingy preppy cheerleader and is the exact stereotype of one. Nick says funnier things than she does, but the sayings just get repetitive and annoying after awhile. Juliet is hard to like because she acts dumb, and is weak and selfish personality wise. The game just isn't long enough to flesh out the characters and story more.

After you beat the game there's no reason to back except for ranking mode to beat scores and unlock new stuff. The game has a lot of potential, but needs some more polish before it can sit among the action/adventure kings like God of War, Tomb Raider, and Bayonetta. The combat is sluggish and cumbersome, the game is short, and the characters aren't developed as well as they could have been. There is tons of visual flair, but the game is lacking technically with some low resolution textures and poor lighting effects.

After all the skepticism and ranting in the world, Color Splash has been released to the general public. This game is the direct sequel to 2012s Paper Mario: Sticker Star on the Nintendo 3DS, where it was welcomed with mostly positive critical receptionbut was also torn apart by fans that realized the game neutered just about everything that made the Paper Mario series what it was. This leaked over to Color Splashs initial reveal, where it was painfully obvious it was repeating the same things that got lambasted in Sticker Star. Now that the former has finally released, how does it fare? Is it as bad as Sticker Star, or are there at least some redeeming qualities to be found this time? Well

The plot of Paper Mario: Color Splash starts off with a scene at Marios house. Peach and Toad #1-of-many, come over to show Mario a blank Toad mailed to them. It just so happens that Mario knows the location this Toad was mailed from, and then they go there to find that the place became a ghost tow-

-----Bowser kidnaps Peach. Defeat the Koopalings and grab the six magical MacGuffins to save the day.-----

Im sorry, but beyond the initial scene setup, the game just does not care about story. This is the worst story in the series, bar none  even including Sticker Star. They try way too hard to hide the fact that Bowser kidnaps Peach before it gets revealed. As a means to lazily add a change to this matter, its explained that Bowser was rolling around in black paint to make his shell look cool; the black paint possesses him and thats why hes doing evil stuff. Heres the problem: Color Splash never elaborates on the black paints role in the story. Bowser is fought as the final boss you expect him to be, and thats it. If anything, it seems more like an excuse to rehash Sticker Stars ending as the only new original character, Huey, makes a heroic sacrifice to combat the black paint much like Kersti from the previous game.

The characterization doesnt exactly get any better, either. I mean, Bowser and Luigi at least have a few speaking lines instead of being mute like last game, but this game has absolutely absurd and kinda disturbing Toad and Shy Guy fetishes. These two types of characters are EVERYWHERE in Color Splash! Shy Guys are fought way more than any other enemy in the game, and Toads just appear to be there. Even in places that don't look homely. Its not like Toads differentiate each other in ways besides colors (or sometimes an accessory or two), either. This makes encounters with Toads playing roles of occupations like a professor, wise mountain sage, train conductor, and pirate captain seem clumsily executed. There are even a couple times where a Toad is stripped of his clothes except for his pants  which Huey explicitly states is a pair of underwear  for no real reason; I don't mean in-game excuses, but rather the game deciding to do that at all.

Ill give credit where credit is due, though: Color Splash DOES have jokes in it. Some can fail to land, but most of them are actually pretty humorous. Its almost as if one of the writers is a veteran from the team behind the original Paper Mario games. There are even some funny scenes that anyone can predict, yet can cue laughter when the literal/visual punchline happens. If anything, Im not so fond of when characters note they're made of paper (But even then, thats been reduced quite a bit in comparison to Sticker Star), as well as the overly goofy animations that play when unleashing special moves in battle. The latter just feels like a video game version of dangling keys. Its cute and endearing. Just not funny. And it drags out the battle. One things for sure: It looks pretty.

No matter how biased one can be when comparing Paper Mario games, no one can deny that the graphics in Color Splash are extremely GORGEOUS!! I mean, holy scrap (Thats a pun the game uses a number of times, but I like it)! The paper aesthetic is simply perfected in this game! There are all sorts of amazing effects and colorful landscapes that you cant help but be lost in awe. The icing on the cake is that the levels are much more creative in scenery than this games predecessor. No more generic Worlds with unspectacular marked locations. Now every level has a proper name and feel (If you look past the abundance of generic enemies and Toads). There are lush gardens, fancily crafted houses, and other dazzling places to explore. Everything about this game looks beautiful, and I would totally love to see this art style applied to a proper Paper Mario game!

At first, I wasn't digging the idea of reusing Sticker Stars emphasis on jazz-like music throughout the game. Now, Im in the middle ground for that. There are plenty of great scores to listen to, without a doubt. When exploring levels and stuff, there are usually tunes that try to capture the fun sort of sound Super Mario games (and arguably older Paper Mario games) tend to carry. It does work out finely. Then Mario encounters an enemy and the battle music plays, nullifying that aspect of Color Splash. I cant believe I have to say that about the battle theme. Mario RPGs usually nail that! Even Sticker Star had a memorable one, despite it just being another Mario theme remix. The battling pieces of this game just do not work for me, with the lone exception being the one for the fight against Lidwig. Sound effects play out as nicely as they usually do, though. They aren't as satisfying as ones in older Paper Marios, but they are serviceable and varied.

Graphics and sound aside, how is the gameplay? You know, the most important part of just about any game ever? Well, even though I mentioned Mario RPGs just a moment ago, Color Splash stresses that it be called an action-adventure game. Its a stupidly vague term, and I refuse to believe this game, Super Paper Mario, Ratchet & Clank, and The Legend of the Mystical Ninja belong in the same genre. That said, this game controls like the original Paper Mario or The Thousand-Year Door, but the levels are structured like a Super Mario game. You go from point A to point B in the stage, grab the star at the end of the course, and its done. That is, unless there are multiple stars in the stage, which means you're bound to replay them to reach the others in order to unlock other levels on the map. NPCs are really just there to be there (Ironically, thats how the Mario & Luigi series handled them too) and complement the setup.

But wait, this paper version of Mario isn't anywhere as acrobatic as regular Mario. How is this executed? Well you see, there are puzzles and obstacles aplenty to keep you busy. Paper Mario games have always been notable for featuring puzzle mechanics in the environments, after all. However, being that this is a sequel to Sticker Star specifically, players that have experienced that game will ponder if Color Splash is as much of a cryptic walkthrough-requiring hellhole. The good news is its not.

The bad news is that the game is now very easy. It will catch players off guard every now and then for a cheap visit to the Game Over screen (Example: An over-sized rolling Chain Chomp that instantly kills Mario upon collision), but aside from that, anyone with the littlest of observation skills can play through Color Splash without a problem. Should you ask Huey for hints though, hes about as helpful as Kersti; sometimes he can tell you the way, other times he just describes the basic objective you already know. You won't need him much, because the levels pretty much have the solutions laid out. All you have to do is play along with them to progress. Do this thing to get to that thing and so on. Basically, this is a LEGO game with the look of a Paper Mario installment. This can be a good thing for fans of LEGO games (especially since this game has phenomenal graphics), but even so they would have to endure Color Splashs combat.

Turn-based battles are still a thing in this game, but considering how its structured it makes me wonder why the game even bothered. The tactical approach is lessened by the fact that the game automatically targets an enemy for you, so if you have multiple cards to play in the way you hope they do, chances are they will instead do Mario harm by accident if you time something wrong or if the game locks on to another enemy unexpectedly. Despite that, its very, very often self-explanatory what has to be done to defeat the enemies. Even during boss battles, they make it extremely clear what Thing (aka special move) you have to use against it to reduce its otherwise unbeatable forces. And whereas Sticker Star hid Things in obscure locations, Color Splash has them out in plain sight. If you somehow don't have an abundance of cards to fight enemies with, you could use the Battle Spinner.

The Battle Spinner has a set of cards spin around until the player taps it to see what the spinner lands on. With good timing, players can abuse this a lot. There are various cards that can be obtained from it, including Mushrooms for healing and even Things. The Battle Spinner costs coins to use, but since the game showers you with coins and paint for nearly everything that the player does in the game, spending coins on anything is a non-issue  let alone the spinner. To top off my gripes with battles, its simply tedious. To pull off any moves, you have to tap and swipe on the Gamepad at a minimum of five times. You swipe through your deck, tap the cards you want to use, press a button to confirm the cards, hold down on the cards to paint them (if you want the attacks to be more powerful), press a button again, and then swipe to flick the cards into play. Just to pull off a move. Whatever happened to just selecting what attack to use, who to use it against, and thats it?

Look, Im not calling Paper Mario: Color Splash a bad game. Its only a mediocre one. It can be enjoyed by people that just want to stroll through and look at pretty landscapes while at it. However, this game has glaring flaws. Those flaws need to be addressed by the developers so they could make things better for the next game in the series, should there be one coming up years later. The level gameplay is best enjoyed by people that have fun with LEGO games, but the combat just doesnt work well. The fights are brief, but they add up to hamper the overall experience. Its a real shame, too, because there are evident areas that the game tries hard to entertain with. It practically has a creative hernia thumping when it shines in its sense of humor and amazing graphics. Yet it falls short. And this isn't even taking into consideration that this is supposed to be the latest of a series that once stood tall and provided a great balance of personality, RPG-puzzle gameplay, and deep/comedic stories!

If you want to play through the game and have a comfortable time with it, you can. Should you buy it at full price? NOOOOOO. Wait for the price drop. LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens already went through a good few, Paper Mario: Sticker Star has dipped since release, and Im sure the same thing will happen here. When it happens, you can use the money saved from the purchase on the Wii U eShop to buy a copy of the original Paper Mario and/or Super Paper Mario.",Falls somewhat flat,1476230400,49,,

3.0,False,"11 22, 2008",ALOI9G09H87IW,B000X9FV5M,Rick Layton,"Far Cry 2 has its moments, but the redundancy and tiresome gameplay bring the game down to mediocrity.

Pros:  Open-ended environments;  solid graphics; good sound field; plethora of objectives and missions.

Cons:  Some graphical glitches; very repetitive gameplay; no native widescreen support; weak characterization and story.

This was one of my most anticipated FPS titles of 2008 and in some ways it lives up to it.  In too many other ways, however, it falls very short.  Just for the fun of it, I re-played the original Far Cry before receiving Far Cry 2 even though I knew that Far Cry 2 had no association and resemblance to the original at all.  They are totally different games with different stories, characters and locations with only the name to oddly tie them together.  To be fair . . . there are a few hang-gliders in Far Cry 2, so I guess there ARE a few similarities.  But, unfortunately, Far Cry 2 is a ""far cry"" from the original Far Cry.

The basic plot of Far Cry 2 deals with two main warring factions attempting to take control of Central Africa's resources and governmental powers.  The main antagonist is a chap by the name of The Jackel who is supplying arms to both side of the conflict, or so it seems.  The objective of the player's character is to assassinate the Jackel which is hoped will de-escalate the conflicts and bring stability to the region.

Some things work in Far Cry 2.  There are very large free-roaming environments and a host of real-world weaponry.  Many of the objects are somewhat destructible.  The graphics and sound designs are good.  There is a form of vegetation regeneration and day, night and weather cycles.  All of that is fine and dandy.  Even the basic premise behind the story is okay albeit under-developed and confusing at times.  A few (very few) of the objectives and missions are fun.

However, Far Cry 2 falls short in the following areas:

1)  Graphical glitches.  Aside from the ""clipping"" issues (which are in many PC games) I found several odd occurrences and annoyances.  One of the oddest occurred after I strategically eliminated the hostiles in a small guard post.  I was still receiving fire from somewhere, but as much as I scanned, I couldn't identify the shooter.  I eventually closed in on the source and found a hostile embedded in a huge boulder.  The gunfire was coming right out of the center of the large rock.  Occasionally I saw a head and gun poke out of the rock.  I couldn't kill him, so I just left.  There were several similar oddities throughout the game such as floating bottles, and the like.

Far Cry 2 also suffers from some general shielding issues.  Most of the time I could shoot through foliage, boards or walls, but there were occasional episodes where a few leaves would block my sniper shots.  On a few occasions I threw grenades only to have them hit leaves in front of me l and bounce back in my lap.  They should have easily gone through the leaves.

2)  The main complaint I had about the game is the never-ending repetitive nature.  Dozens of missions were exactly the same. The only variation was the location. I go to the cell tower to get the assassination order.  Then I travel across the map to where the target stands.  The targets all dress in grey suits and carry brief cases or clipboards.  They just walk around in loops until you kill them.  Over and over again it went.  I also experienced some glitches with these missions.  On several occasions, I successfully killed the target, but the script wouldn't activate as ""accomplished.""  The map still showed the objective as open.  The only way to continue was to accept another mission and abandon the glitchy one.

Then there were the ""destroy the convoy"" missions.  Again, most of these were across the map and when you get to the target, you find a truck - usually with one or two guard vehicles - circling an area over and over again.  You blow it up and move on.  After about 20 or so of these missions, I began to think that I wanted my eight hours back.

Then there were the idiotic malaria twists the developers threw in (to add some suspense to the boring game, I guess).  You get some transit documents you must deliver and, in return, you get the medication.  Over and over it went.  No matter where you were sent, the buildings were exactly the same with the guys by the door and the same families in the back room.  At this point, I thought that the developers basically scripted three or four missions and then just looped them over and over hundreds of times with tiny variations in location.

The only ""enjoyable"" missions were the mult-faceted variety where I had to complete several varied objectives.  These were usually given by faction leaders and, occasionally, by buddies. These were challenging and fun, for the most part.  Also, the very ending mission with the plethora of baddies was a little more engaging (FINALLY some action after 40 hours of gameplay!) Unfortunately, these types of missions were the exception, not the rule.  I would say that 80% of the missions were of the repetitive, redundant variety.

The diamonds used for bartering was fine, but to hide them in little suitcases on top of boulders, trees, and rooftops is rather ridiculous and, in my opinion, juvenile.  Maybe that was added to appease the twelve-year-olds.

3)  The AI was inconsistent.  Hostiles did pursue and flank, but not smartly. And it was very predictable.  The accuracy of the AI shooting was unrealistic.  Often hostiles ran at full speed while I dodged and swerved into brush fifty yards away and I was still hit numerous times. Yeah, sure.  Sometimes, I had to LOL as hostile vehicles flew off cliffs or into the rivers trying to get to my location. Sometimes unarmed vehicles came at me and all I had to do was to shoot the drivers in the head as they neared.  Idiots!

The spawning thing also was an annoyance.  Obviously it wasn't meant to be realistic.  I would destroy a guard post and then return minutes later only to find the exact same guards alive and well again and all the destroyed vehicles fully operable. I must have killed Joey the Guard like 238 times.

4)  No widescreen support.  I was shocked when I found that widescreen was just cropped full screen. Using widescreen takes full screen images and slices the top and bottom off and then stretches them to fit the screen.  What kind of cheap developer's shortcut was that!!  I did find a tool to correct it, but I expected something better from a premium 2008 FPS game!

5) I saved fairly often - mainly because I didn't want to travel the 40 miles over the barren African landscape over again if I died. But each time you save, the list has to ""refresh"" and depending upon how many saved games you have, the refresh time could be substantial.  I ended up having to visit the ""saved games"" folder regularly to clear it out.

6) The night play was too bright. I'd rather have night actually dark.  Stealth was non-existent.  I couldn't tell any difference buying the ""camo"" outfit for cover.  No matter how silent I sneaked up on a hostile and used my machete, the whole camp was immediately aware of my presence.  They missed a huge opportunity to implement a good stealth mode to the game.

7)  I was also disappointed that there wasn't more variety in the animals in Africa. I think it would've added a lot of suspense to the game to include a few dangerous animals.  I could just imagine walking upon some lions and then having to run for my life or gun them down.  It would've been hilarious to be trampled by an elephant.  It would've given the game a little more ""edge"" to it as well as some reality to the environment. I also would've liked some moving trains and I was a little disappointed that, at the airfield, I couldn't get into a plane to try to fly it.  Even if it resulted in a crash and death, it would've been worth it just to try to fly it.

Because of the tiresome and repetitive gameplay, I have to knock off a good 3 points off the gameplay score.  After playing the game, I am leery about its replay value as well.  There are no ""wow"" levels.  Everything looks pretty much the same.  The missions are very repetitive and redundant.  There are really no memorable moments during the 40 hours or so of gameplay.  Because of that, I have no motivation to play the game again.  Once through is enough.  Without a doubt, the original Far Cry was better.  In fact, I could play that again right now and look forward to every level of that game. I would score Far Cry 2 as follows:

A sequel to one of the best games of the generation should be awesome, but it was not. The story really took a hit in this sequel. The great voice overs by Miss Parker were surprisingly missing. In fact no one except Hale makes an appearance in both games. It's almost like Insomniac took all the good from the first game and threw it away for Resistance 2. The story is only a set up for more action it is not a companion as in the first one. The overall look of the game is different as well. The first was drab and dreary; the second one is bright and cheery. The graphics are a step up from the first one. That is about the only improvement. The game play has changed for the worse and the story as well.

Presentation- The look of this game has a lot of orange in it which takes away from the dread of the franchise which is a huge mistake. The music is about the same as the first. There aren't as many cut scenes which hurt the overall story and feel of the game. The graphics are an advancement however over the first. 4/5

Graphics- The graphics do look pretty good compared to Resistance: Fall of Man. The environments are pretty lush and natural looking. The facial models look ok Hale looks great the others don't look as good. 4/5

Game Play- The game play has changed a lot from Resistance 1. You can no longer hold all the weapons in the game. You are confined to two at a time. The game is also very difficult. Even in the casual setting it is challenging. They have added a lot of alien hybrids as well. This can be frustrating because it makes them feel unrealistic. These are supposed to be alien human hybrids then how can they be the size of a sky scraper. Also there are a lot of spawn problems. You really have to be careful where you walk the enemies can spawn at any time. They can also kill you randomly with one shot, which gets really annoying. The edition of rumble does help you feel like you're actually shooting the Chimera. 3.5/5

Story- As I stated above the story took a big hit in this title. There are no interesting voice overs and the few # of cut scenes in general does not help. In fact you could take the title off of the front of the case and you might not be able to tell it's a Resistance game. The ending does have some interesting elements, but the story as a whole is disappointing. 3/5

Lasting Appeal- The game in my opinion only has lasting appeal if you want to follow beating the first one with beating this game. There is very little to come back for. There is a big multiplayer element, but I am not a fan of online. They completely scrapped the co op split screen, which was a great part of the first one. It did however have a great ending that some how saved the game from being completely a waste of time. 3/5

The Verdict: I recommend this game for people who have never played the original. If you love the original skip this title, and read a plot summary before Resistance 3 comes out. I hope they can make a better game to save this franchise and make a great trilogy. Overall this game is action packed with lots of enemies, but the lack of story and changes in game play elements hurts this title.

3.0,False,"04 5, 2009",A1SHSOJRHEBL92,B000ZK6950,A. Nonimowse.,"Resident Evil 5 is a third person shooter with a sprinkling of horror added to it to be able to use the Resident Evil name.  The game takes place in Africa where a pair of protagonists are attempting to stop some kind of sinister scheme that involves turning people into ultra-violent zombie-like creatures.  You'll battle a few different kinds of enemies using a wide variety of mostly the same feeling guns.  You'll also battle awkward controls, a limiting inventory, a crappy checkpoint/save system, and boredom.  Lastly, you'll run into too many ""boss"" fights that are exercises in repetition and frustration.  The entire game is a battle, but not in the sense that many are probably expecting.

Resident Evil 5 takes some of the elements of horror-survival such as: crappy inventory management and awkward controls, and integrates them with nearly endless ammo supply (conveniently dropped by most bad guys) and a weapon upgrade system.  Sounds like a weird combination, and it is.

Early on the game feels sort of horror-y as you don't really know what is happening, your weapons are weak, and the environments are claustrophobic.  As the game progresses you'll quickly realize that the variety in enemies is not that great and that you can upgrade your weapons, fairly rapidly, to substantial levels.  Yes, you do feel horror when dealing with certain enemies -- because some are ridiculously tough (like the dogs or the lickers) and can be a pain to contend with as your controls are not overly conducive to coping with anything near and not directly in front of you.

Later on in the game it becomes a really poorly designed third person shooter with an irritatingly lame attempt at a cover system.  Nothing like zombie soldiers with guns.  Lame.  I won't even get started on the absurdly monotonous ""quicktime"" button mashing sequences.  Who thought this garbage was good, and why is there so much of it in this game?  Those sequences remind me of Jericho...  and that was probably the worst game I've ever played on the 360.

As the game progresses you will gain access to a wide variety of weapons.  If you have been upgrading you won't see much point in switching over to a new weapon which is not upgraded.  Most of the guns feel basically the same, with minor differences.  Grenades are kind of a hassle, the proximity mines are cool if you don't mind lots of running around, the grenade launcher isn't bad (but strangely flies really slowly), but mostly it all feels the same.  I found no reason to switch to a ""new"" version of a weapon I currently had because my upgraded one wailed on the new version.

The inventory system is quirky, and clunky.  I couldn't find a way to remove ammo from a weapon (if you want to empty one to switch to another) and I couldn't find a way to split up stacked items.  Let's say you have five grenades, and you want to split them between you and Sheva (who doesn't seem to use them, anyhow) -- you can't.  You can only move five at a time.  Same thing with ammo.

Some maps are interesting and seem to have a lot of space to move around, and others are dull and very rail like.  At first I was wooed by the shanty towns of Africa, but once you get indoors the maps just kind of fall flat.  The factory maps are just plain irritating -- I won't ruin it for you, I'll let you experience those gems for yourself.

The story itself is very trite and generic.  The plot ""twists"" are so cliche that they don't even surprise you.  The cinematics (acting, and animations) are something that you have to suffer through -- perhaps that is why they call it a horror game.  I dread when I have to watch a cut scene and groan at the stale lines and over the top delivery.

All in all, I'd say that this game is a dud.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.  It was just kind of...  ehh...  I say this being a fan of the originals, but also judging the game based on its own merits.  With the exception of certain characters and little bits and pieces, this is hardly a Resident Evil game.  It could have been named something else, with the characters named something else, and nobody would have thought it was related at all.  Normally if a game is good I feel compelled to play it through like some ravenous cookie monster tearing into a box of cookies...  not so with this.  I can barely suppress the apathy long enough to play through until the next stage so I can actually save my progress.

Now, to PES 2013. The front end is still reminiscent of the look and sounds of Konami titles like Blades of Steel, Double Dribble, or Contra. Try it, you'll see: jingly, flashing menus, circa 1987 arcades. Call me conditioned to Xbox-era western developer ethos, along with their sights and sounds, or call Konami hopelessly stuck in a cycle of recreating the feel of 80s arcade games, the cycle that's seemingly doomed the once-mighty Japanese video game empire.

Now, the experience: inauthentic. While other titles shoot for a ""you're on the team"" effect and benefit from camera angles and commentary befitting an ESPN broadcast, this game has a bit of ""oooooohh, look it's Juventus vs Barcelona---be impressed, you're supposed to be impressed!"" without the gritty feel of game day, of settling into the bleachers or the living room couch.

Now, the gameplay: Meh. It's jerky. Malign the other title as you will for its moody ball and clumsy athletes, but this game suffers from huge G-force problems as the players jerk 90 and 180 degrees with the camera oddly changing direction right along with them--it's the antithesis of immersion. It's ridiculous. I don't like using the adjective ""arcadey"" but, well, it's super arcadey.

If it has one thing that sets its gameplay apart (positively) from other games, it's the footwork, dribbling and ""close combat"" aspect. The other title has this problem that's been going on for twenty years. See, dribble up to or pass to someone near the penalty box and something maddening almost always happens. All the midfielders and defense bunched up there will put one foot forward or run past you and voila they have stolen the ball. Ninety five percent of the time. Maddening.

This does not happen much in PES, if you have a little skill. You can dribble in, change direction, juke, make nice passes, and--wow, imagine this, SHOOT--most of the time. Little more fun. Little more unpredictable. Not sure if based in reality, but don't care. I think for pick-up-and-play casual matches against friends, this game may have a slight edge.

To go from the masterpiece that was the original Symphonia to this was disappointing.

All of the old voice actors who came back were clearly not getting paid enough as they put in half the effort for their characters that they did in the first game. I commend the new voice actress for Sheena and the new voice actors for Genis and Zelos. They did the best work among the new voice actors. The game's story is overly drawn out and lacks the good flow one expects from a Tales of game. The combat could be better but it isn't entirely terrible. Emil can be hard to control and while Marta has some great close combat moves she will easily be designated as your primary healer and magic user. The monster capture system added nothing spectacular to the mix. The fixed status of the original playable characters makes them useless for the most part (especially when replaying the game to attempt 100% completion).

3.0,False,"07 8, 2016",A2Y8NVOFEBVSC0,B01BGSF9DC,Megabear,"This game does some things extremely well, and others fall extremely short.

Pros:
- Blasts you with fun, backed by a creative formula that combines character development, puzzle, strategy and action smoothly.
- Satisfying and diverse combat movements
- Deep customization options where RNG takes you to glory or more farming.
- War is a nice touch.  No allegiance is required and you are not really penalized for playing for all sides.
- Boardgame like movements is a nice touch, where field skills matter in achieving your goals.
- For some this game can have lots of replayability.

Cons:
- As detailed this game seems at first, the lack of items and monster variety is astounding.  You are more or less stuck with 1, if you're lucky 2 to choose from, weapon(s) variety per class throughout the game.
- The story is as generic as it gets.  I'm not sure if I could have written it that bad if I had tried.
- Characters are unbalanced.  As of now Valkyries are clearly the most powerful, whereas Challengers are clearly the least powerful.
- Extremely repetitive.  When it comes down to it, you're going to be entering that same combat mode over and over again and not much else other than moving your ""piece"" (character) across what looks like a board game.  Makes you feel rather claustrophobic.
- War is surprisingly short and unrewarding.  As of now, there really isn't any benefit to winning other than few negligible items mostly and pride.
- No true PvP in this game.  Every time you fight, it's against an AI, even against player made teams.
- Oversexualization is apparent with some characters.  Makes me embarrassed to play in front of kids.
- Lastly devs aren't involved at all and nearly all of the player base don't seem to expect any major patches.  So you're likely to be stuck with whatever the game has to offer for the moment.","This game does some things extremely well, and others fall extremely short.",1467936000,7,{'Edition:': ' PlayStation 4 - Launch Day Edition'},

You are Dominic, pupil of Aldo Tripani, the main character of the first movie. After Aldo is killed in the Cuban Revolution, Dominic takes over the Florida business interests, while Michael, who is strangely voiced by a George Clooney impersonator, watches from the shadows as you wipe out the rival southern families.

Rather than be a one man army, you're required to take on a crew of specialists that perform the acts that you were capable of in the first game. Aside from changes in driving, with every car handling like an 18 wheeler, and weapon upgrades being random finds rather than purchases, the play is virtually the same. There are some new bells and whistles, with interactable items and a variety of venues, but the premise is still to fire more bullets than the enemy.

The movie inspired missions and scenes feel more stapled on. Rather than being integral to the ascension of the Corleone family, you are more a passer in the night, and the scenes try to bleed out slowly to expand the gameplay, but only makes it rather frustrating. The voice acting is tolerable, and the face creation is rather impressively varied. Graphics are nice, but the range is so short than driving at higher than 40 gives the impression that cars and buildings are warping in from another dimension, and text requires that you have macronocular vision or an impressive 5 figure TV.

Had this game been longer or more varied, it would've held up better. AS it stands, it doesn't have enough improvements to make up for the solid material that was removed from the first game. No more hit missions apart from bizarre grinding favors, no intelligent leveling, text thats impossible to read and watered down, subordinates that're useful, but cookie cutter to the point that I have a set of identical triplets in my family.

I was excited to get the fightstick because I got a very good deal on it. Unfortunately, it arrived with a broken Heavy Punch button. It just wouldn't work. I bought the fightstick from Amazon via [...], so Amazon was not responsible to replace the product, which meant I had to get a replacement from [...], but they were out of stock. I could simply take a refund, but I still wanted the fightstick, so I called up Mad Catz to see what they could do for me.

1st Call: They told me to go talk to Buy.com.

2nd Call: They tried to help me fix the stick myself over the phone. This did not work since the cables inside were too tightly connected. In the end, I wound up damaging the button beyond (home) repair. They said I should send it to them and they would repair it themselves, but they wanted me to pay the shipping! I couldn't understand why I should pay the shipping costs when it was their fault it was broken in the first place. (Obviously, no one tested the unit before it left the manufacturing facility.)

3rd Call: I managed to talk to someone who would send me a new button and cable set free of charge, so long as I did the repairs at home. I figured this was better than nothing, so I accepted. After I received it, I rewired the new button into the circuit board, but I soon discovered that the button was never broken at all. The circuit board simply wasn't receiving input from it. I verified this by connecting a different (normally working) button to the same spot and finding it ineffective.

At this point, I was so frustrated that I then rewired the Heavy Punch button into the 3 Punches contact point and just change the button configuration accordingly, something I could have done days ago. In other words, Mad Catz did almost nothing to help me. Yes, I could have had them repair the fightstick themselves, but it would have felt wrong to me. How can they sell a defective product like that and then just expect someone to pay $10 or more to ship it back?!

Also (just FYI), there have been a good number of reports of fightsticks of this type being broken to begin with or becoming broken faster than a user would expect. Buyer beware.

That said, when it's working, the Street Fighter IV FightStick is one of the best ways to get the arcade experience at home. The buttons and stick are as responsive as one would expect and (so long as one is used to using his fingers to hit the buttons) it should not be a problem to pull off most special moves.

So, in summary, only buy this product if you buying from a company besides Mad Catz who is able to replace the fightstick for free. Amazon.com itself would probably be great to buy from.","Great product, if you're lucky",1273449600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",
3.0,True,"03 22, 2009",A1RZ0773I44LVB,B00181BHVQ,Kevin Doyle,"I have not owned a wired mouse since the early 90s.

I am a World of Warcraft player, hunter class, and enjoyed learning all the techniques to maximize the gameplay. One of these is called a jumpshot, where I would be running away with my back towards the target, I leap into the air and spin back towards the target, shoot, and land facing away again. This is a tremendous technique, as hunters having a speed buff, I can outrun most of the opponents, and still shoot at them. This technique requires skill, and a lot of practice. Try as I might, I was never very good at it, and really did not feel confident to use this technique in actual matches. Needless to say, I was at a big disadvantage without this ability.

I happened to be talking with a friend about this, and he inquired about my mouse. Not really knowing, I told him I had a nice Bluetooth wireless mouse that I like a lot. He started to smile, and said, ""just get a razer and a mousepad"". A mousepad??? I have not had one of those since the days before optical sensors...and what is a ""razer""?

Being a Mac guy, he told me to just get the DeathAdder for Mac, and one of their Destructor pads. Since Amazon lets me return anything I don't like, I bought the setup.

When they arrived I was impressed with the packaging and professional look of the items. I now understand Razer is the company for gaming mice, and I was about to understand why.
The mouse moves on the pad as if it was levitating. It feels almost spooky it is so smooth, like a ball bearing on glass. The mouse is designed to have a very light touch for click and right click, and feels great in my hands.

One of the main features is on-the-fly sensitivity adjustment. Push the mouse wheel down and dial the right sensitivity, even in-game. I open WoW and started trying the jumpshot. After only about a minute of trial-and-error adjusting the sensitivity...I was doing the move like a pro. I could not believe it...all this time I thought I did not have the coordination to do it, but I was wrong. Shortly after that, a number of my opponents were quickly dispatched and I earned a bunch of honor points that day.

OK, I got it...gaming mice have to be wired, special sensor, special pad...all worth it.

Now unfortunately, it is not all singing and dancing. The software for the DeathAdder is, in my opinion, god-awful. It is fragile, clumsy and as unintuitive as you could possibly imagine. I understand gaming is a Windows stronghold, and Razer only touts this one mouse model as Mac compatible, so I did not expect that they have a Mac programmer on staff. The key to Mac programmers, is that the Apple Human Interface Guidelines is the book they live by. Adherence to its principles guarantees user-centric, optimally-intuitive designs.

On the other hand, somebody simple porting a Windows app to the Mac provides none of this tuning that Mac users not only expect, but demand.

The mouse has five profiles in it that the user can switch to. This involves pushing a button on the bottom of the mouse, and watching to see the LEDs in the mouse flash the correct number of times to match the profile. In practice this is sooo clumsy, and many time would fail causing the mouse to freeze up, and requiring I unplug it and reconnect to reset the condition. I still cannot believe that the software does not contain the ability to automatically switch profiles when I switch applications. I don't want to think about it past when I programmed it...just switch when I open that app.

OK, I gave up on the stupid profiling thing...I have my Logitech MX mouse running, and when I switch to Warcraft, I reach for the DeathAdder and really love it. It is just sad that such a great device and pad has such lousy software. So buy one (don't forget the pad too) and enjoy your games a LOT more...but expect frustration from the software. I hope they make it right soon.",Awesome mouse - Lousy Software,1237680000,14,,

*sigh*  I had hopes.  In fact I had high hopes, and that's what makes it so dissapointing.

It's been said a lot - Most Wanted was a great game.  A fantastic game.  One of the very few games I decided to play through twice just to try a different approach.

What made Most Wanted different for a driving game was a compelling story.  It wasn't even a very deep story, but you had conflict right from the get-go and it made you eager - no, determined - to get revenge.  It gave you a clear, linear story - 8 ""bad guys"" (I think it was eight...) to take on until you reached the baddest dude of all - the guy who took your car, took your reputation, even tried to take your girl...  But in between those linear points, the game was a free-for-all.  You had set things you had to do, but you could do them in any order, you could do them however you wanted.  You always knew were the next objective was, but still had that freedom.

Undercover is just a cluster.  There's roads everywhere, cops everywhere, races everywhere...  You have no idea what to do.  The story is clear only because we've read about it here on Amazon, on other review sites...  Honestly, the game has never told ME that I'm an undercover cop.

The came starts with a car chase - you at the wheel - and a million cops behind you.  You're in a 350z, pretty decked out, Red.  Suddenly you get away.  Then you're watching a clandestine meeting between a woman and a shadowy, male figure.  She says he's going to be their driver.  It wasn't until my second re-start (tried a different console) that I realized, ""Oh, I guess I'm that guy...""  Next thing you know you're sitting on the street in a POS Nissan.  What happened to the 350z?  What am I doing?  What's the objective?  Who am I??

So you start running races - easy to do, just push down on the D-pad and it'll automatically launch the next race.  You'll run a few races and then get a short, somewhat vague cut-scene.  That'll open up a unique race - which you'll run - and nothing special will happen.  So you'll do a few more races, then something else suddenly happens...  It's really only curiosity that keeps you playing.  There's no motivation, no apparent pay-off...  I've played now for a bunch of hours and still have only unlocked a small handful of parts.  I never understood that theory - you have enough money to buy something but it won't let you.  The game just levels up the opponent cars anyways - let me buy whatever I can afford!

As far as actual game play goes, it's... ...alright.  Graphics are okay up close, but distances get real vague.  There are a LOT of aliasing issues, and items appear very blocky and granular.  I've had a couple frame-rate issues during auto-saves and what-not - VERY frustrating in a driving game while you're drifting a corner at 140 miles per hour.  Technical tracks become challenging because you can't see far ahead.  You can, but you can't make out what you're looking at.  Is that a turn?  Oh, no - it's a bridge abutment...  Oh and forget the map.  The cities of Undercover are pretty convoluted, which is nice, except that the map doesn't detail elevation changes.  So an intersection that appears on the map could actually be a bridge going over another road.  Oh yeah - that's fun when you're trying to dart a corner while running from cops...  *SMASH* - oh, THAT road is BENEATH me!!!  Thanks for the help!  You're under arrest...

I of course have no idea how far into the game I am, but it's not very challenging.  I've won every race, and have ""dominated"" all but a few of the ""jobs.""  The cops are present, but they lack that... ...je ne c'est pas...  They have no spirit - no soul.  They appear out of nowhere - hit a chase-breaker (usually a road-side object that you can hit to stop chasing police cars) and the game goes into a quick cut-scene to watch the destruction.  That's always fun, except that I've come out of those cut scenes only to plow into a road block that appeared out of nowhere.  Very frustrating.  **UPDATE**  Even MORE frustrating when those roadblocks include a spike strip in later levels of the game...  Sure ended THAT chase pretty quickly.  Thanks EA!!!  **/UPDATE**  The [cops] seem to pit-maneuver you pretty easily - suddenly accelerating out of nowhere...  But if you keep dodging, taking corners instead of following the road, this isn't much of an issue.  They just don't have the organization of Most Wanted.  When you think you're about to escape, more will appear out of NOWHERE.  When you finally do escape, they literally dissapear!  In instances when you're TRYING to rack up more points, more cop-car-kills, more damage, etc, you can't!

A lot of the game just seems tacked on.  Remember the first ""Underground"" NFS games?  There were shops everywhere that focused on specific areas, like body parts, performance parts, certain brands of cars...  Now you just push start [pause] and select ""Cars.""  You basically buy cars and customize them from the pause menu.  How pathetic is that??  And if you actually go to a shop, you see the EXACT same screen.

The ""crews"" from Carbon are gone - thank God.  You don't have to hire certain staff members just to customize your car.  Autosculpting is available immediately and that's a welcome change.

NFS Undercover quickly becomes boring.  You run a race, unlock some new races, run some of them, and maybe if you're lucky you'll trigger the next story sequence.  But you have no idea, you have no motivation, and all you're left with is another highly anticipated let-down.

Stop doing this, gaming industry.  Quit focusing on the dollar and make us some games that are worth playing.  We're tired of looking behind us at ""what was.""  Give us something to look forward to, or quit wasting our money.  I'm tired of the $60-dollar coasters.

**UPDATE**

I have to say, the last 1/4 to 1/3 of this game was nearly unplayable.  These games are completely unrealistic when it comes to high-speed ""simulation.""

Throughout the game you have ""highway battles.""  On these challenges, you race against a singular AI opponenet, and have to usually get 1000 feet ahead of them to ""win.""  Of course you start off behind them, and - big surprise, they're automatically pulling away from you.""  In the begining they were easy, towards the middle they were challenging, and at the end they were impossible.  Why?  Well, because you're allegedly going 230 miles an hour, going over blind hills and around blind corners in a see of traffic, up against an opponent who of course has impeccable reaction and timing.  The only way you could win these was to get lucky and have the AI ""goof,"" smacking into a car at the exact same time that you got a clear straightaway to put some distance between you.  But many times I'd pile up into a STACK of AI ""traffic"" cars, and watch as the opponent deftly weaved around them like it was a cakewalk.  Completely unrealistic, completely impossible, and utterly frustrating.  I beat the game, and gave up on the rest of the ""completion"" achievements.

Yeah, this is worst game of the rebooted series and all the negatives are true. However, it's still better than most of other hack n slash games. The bar was set so high in 2004 that even a crappy followup today by a different team is still a decent action game.

Although this game is badly reviewed throughout, it is still worth one play through, even for a Ninja Gaiden veteran like myself. Most people see this game as crap because it carries the Ninja Gaiden name and the main character Ryu Hayabusa, but it doesn't play like a Ninja Gaiden game. Games with this name need to live up to certain standards. Naturally, those standards are completely broken in the latest, so fans across the board stumped on it.

3.0,False,"10 2, 2009",A1F7AFVBKHSOT8,B001TD6SK8,Matthew Erwin,"Here is a game that could have been so much better than it is.  Even so, it makes an entertaining, if lesser chapter into the Kingdom Hearts Series.

First the good.  The game controls great.  Clever use of shortcuts makes magic casting a breeze and the action for better or worse in primarily controlled by mashing on the A button, occasionally using B and Y to jump and block/roll respectively.  The fighting is good for what it is, but mostly it is a bit simplistic.

Sadly the whole game is a bit simplistic.  It is clear the developers wanted to focus on graphics and story.  What they wound up with is a game that looks almost as good as its PS2 counterparts.  The story on the other hand is a bit muddled and what starts out as a cute bromance turns into a constant irritation.  My god, I don't care about them eating icecream for the 85th day in a row.

Also missing from the game is any bit of exploration.  The worlds are depressingly simple and small, generally consisting of a few large rooms or spaces with few more caves/rooms opening up later in your missions.  That brings me to the other big problem with the game which is the mission structure.  Simply put, it is not nearly as fun as just a regular Kingdom Hearts game.  85% of the missions boil down to either kill a bunch of Heartless or kill one specific Heartless.  It begins to drag with a flustering amount of sameness.  Every once in a while you will come across an exploration mission which generally involves running around until a question mark pops up over Roxas's hear and you press A.  There are also a few missions that you have to follow a character, which are about as dumb as they sound.

The characters from Disney and other Square series are pushed to the backburner here as well, it is mostly about Organization XIII and run parallel to the events of Chain of Memories.

The final problem with the game, as alluded to by other reviewers is the panel system, which seems to be an odd combination of a card game, the materia system from Final Fantasy VII and Diablo's loot system.  You can place different panels into your inventory to do basically anything including learn moves and magic.  The most irritating panel could be the level up panel.  This is certainly the first game where you have to equip a level up.  You get to make irritating decisions such as ""Do I level up or take 'cure' into the battle""  Do I want more casts of fire or to have the ability to block.  It seems some things, such as new tactics and level ups should be automatic.  I guess it adds in a new strategy to the game, but mostly I find it irritating.

That all being said, if you can look past the irritants, there is a lot of fun to be had here, especially for those who are already fans (for those that haven't played KH before, good luck following the story).  This one is for the fans only.",Good but not great,1254441600,86,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Woody,"Overall, I found that the game was solid, found very few bugs and was very stable while being played, but there were a few things that brought the game down a bit for me. Firstly, the graphics while playing aren't exactly stellar, despite the cut-scenes being very good.
A lot of the control surfaces and command sequences are kind of counter-intuitive, and felt outdated and a little forced.

The gameplay itself was good, the storyline was engaging and kept you wanting to see where it went. The characters were a little 2-D at times, and often their responses to conversations sounded a little cliche, but it was easy to look past. Character customization was a breeze, and offered a number of different tactical options based on player preference. I am a ""shoot first"" type of person, and customized that route, while my roommate played more as a sneak, and both of us were able to make great use of the customizations offered.

Pros:
-Solid game engine, no performance issues
-Excellent storyline and progression
-Cut-scenes are beautifully rendered
-Multiple customizations available depending on player preference: sneak around, or simply burn everything down by coming through the front door.

Cons:
-Game controls could stand polishing
-Gameplay graphics are nothing to write home about

Are there flaws?  Yes.  Not as bad as what's being reported though.

There's plenty of game modes, but they're all fairly similiar.  Franchise and GM have all the same options with the exception of four or five manageable goals if you enter GM mode.  Completing goals raises your GM grade and increases budget.  The other negligable difference is that Franchise mode allows you to force trades through with the computer controlled teams, GM mode makes you use the ""Fair Trade"" system.  Which is hardly ever fair, even if you're trying to deal outside of your rival teams.  Both GM and franchise allow you to look at team pulse and measure team chemistry, which can make players better or worse.  You can call team meetings and choose your appropriate response to your teams recent play (note: It's not a good idea to make fun of all your player's mothers on the first day of the season, but the option is there).  Depending on the meeting and player, his morale will go up or down.  In both Franchise and GM mode, you can buy scouting reports on players/teams for a chunk of money. Depending on the team, it can get pricey.  There's also a home-run derby you can play, a manager mode (which consists of watching a screen, picking how you'd manage the game in a drop-down menu, and watching the results...zzz...), and a situation game.  Want to put your guy up in the bottom of the ninth with two men out, the bases juiced, and a full count?  Here's your shot.

There's a LOT of detail in this game, however they were very sloppy about several details.  A home opener in Milwaukee has the chance of rain.  This is all and well, except Miller Park has a retractable roof.  Maybe I'm nitpicking.  Players fall over if they collide on-field or into the walls.  This is extremely frustrating when you run down a ball in center field only to fall over from hitting the wall, even though it never would've happened in the majors.  Players overlap first, and get thrown out on a late relay.  If there's a runner safe on third, and you have the ball at home, a simple throw to third will get the computer to try for home 50-60% of the time.  Easy out, but very unrealistic.

Batting is an improvement, the swing stick makes hitting the ball easier than ever.  The L-stick is your hitters eye, line it up with where you think the pitch is going and if the pitch goes there, it helps you out when you swing.  If you pick the wrong area, everyone in the stadium laughs at you.  You pull back on the R-stick when the pitcher releases and let go for contact.  If you're a purist you can choose to push or pull the ball by going left/right on the R-stick.  Pushing all the way forward is a power swing.  You can choose to use all of this, or use none of it and have X be your swing button.  Be warned, the game will also freeze periodically during the pitch.  That tenth of a second is enough to really mess up the timing.  It is rare, but it does happen (especially online).

Baserunning frustrated me to no end until I realized in 2K's quest to simplify everything, they made it more complex.  Directional pad left tells all your runners to advance one base, DP right is to return.  The computer will tell your runners what to do if you do not.  You do not want this to happen.  I recommend selecting each runner individually with X, O, triangle, and square and use L1 to advance them ahead, or R1 to retreat them back.  This is still highly irregular and nowhere near the perfection of the MVP series.

Pitching is the most accurate part of the game.  You have to set a breaking point for your pitches with movement in order to compensate for the break of the ball.  After two strikes, or in a pitching jam, you're given the option of throwing a payoff pitch.  If you hit the target that's lit up on the screen, the pitch rating increases the rest of the game.  You do not want to miss it, though.

The thing that single most bothers me about the game, however, is the player rating system.  ESPN prides the game on being based on three years of statisics, then does injustices to each player in it by insulting them with their rating system.  It's obvious they're playing favorites with a team like the Yankees, and throwing guesses to the rest of the teams around the league.  Before you play, you might want to readjust the attributes to everyone on your team.  I wish I was kidding.

This is the price of one companies monopoly on sports licensing.  You get inferior products because they know you can't buy anything else.  I'm not going to say it's a great game, but it's not horrible either.  With outside competition, however, it would've been a lot better.  3/5",Avoid all other reviews,1145750400,5,,

Like most others, I loved the original R:FoM and have replayed it many times.  I was greatly anticipating a second go round with this title release.  Unfortunately, my hopes weren't realized.

Is R2 a bad game?  No.  But is is a significant step back from the original R:FoM.  I would also say that R2 is no more than a very average PS3 title at best.  Its shortcomings definitely smack of a game rushed to market in time for the holidays.

The problems?  Whereas RFoM had a great backstory, R2 barely has one at all and what's there is very underdeveloped.  R2 kind of just leans on what was told in the first game more than advancing the story.

Next, and this is the biggest problem with R2, is level design.  It's terrible.  It looks like very little time and thought was put into them.  RFoM had tremendous level design that was well thought out and allowed for individuality in your approach to tackling enemies and completing missions.  R2's levels however, are so terribly restrictive and linear that there is very little room to stray off the beaten path laid out for you, and thus offers very little replay value.

Another disappointment is the graphics and game camera.  I have a 60"" 1080P television and RFoM looks fabulous on it.  I was rather shocked at how little effort was put into graphic details of R2.  This was one of the most anticiapted games on PS3 this year and I expected much more than what I saw, which was average to below average visuals.  As far as the camera goes, it's terribly frustrating and awkward compared to the original.  You get used to it and adapt your tactics to your limited vision in R2, but it's always annoying you in crucial moments of the game.

That being said, here are some impressions I've received so far:

PROS: Love the general format of brutal reality, where you can be taken out just as easily as in real combat
  The graphics are quite good, although the pale color scheme does take away from it somewhat
  Like the freedom of movement of the ""sandbox"" environment--I've done objectives from many different angles already

CONS: AI can be totally absurd, to your detriment--as others have mentioned, your squadmates can be complete lunkheads at times (giving away your position, getting themselves and you shot, etc.);
  the enemy can somehow magically see your prone figure as it lies in tall grass, above their position, completely hidden, and can shoot you accurately in those same conditions!!
  Also, the enemy is just as accurate with a simple assault rifle from distances that you're having trouble with using a Barrett .50 heavy sniper rifle from
  TIMED MISSIONS STINK!  Exactly what kind of raving lunatic dreamed up the second mission--it's a ""stealth"" mission, with the express directive to avoid contact, yet they put you on a timer
  (making it impossible to use ""stealth""!), and they give you unsilenced weapons, so as soon as you engage those you have to, the whole island knows exactly where you are!!
  The ""Quick Command Radial"" can be terribly annoying to use, especially when under fire--to be fair, though, I don't know of better ways to give multiple commands without simply talking

Granted, this IS an interesting, fun game--it's kind of like an action movie that tries to be realistic, yet keeps ruining scenes with competely unrealistic stunts.  I have always liked the harsher military titles, because I understand that real combat is brutally unforgiving; BUT, a real human opponent still has the same limitations as you (they can't see through walls or other obstacles, and they can't shoot through those and hit unseen targets!).  I totally believe the reviewer that told how he got shot with an ASSAULT RIFLE while SITTING IN A TANK!

I also understand the choice on the graphics--they're trying to give a gritty, documentary look to it, hence the muted colors and tones.  It works well--it just gets a bit tiring after a while, and makes it much more difficult than it should be trying to pick out enemy soldiers hiding among trees and brush (I don't know how many times I've been in a firefight, with the enemy straight ahead, my guys firing away, and I can't find anything to shoot at).

Overall, I wouldn't discourage this title from others, especially now that the prices are in bargain-bin territory.  It can be very fun, but be prepared for it to be extremely annoying at times, too.  Calling in an artillery strike is quite fun, with a great bombardment to witness.  The weapons, while sounding decent, could use more ""oomph"", ESPECIALLY the Barrett (that beast should sound like a cannon when you fire it).  The sounds and effects when being shot at are first-rate, with whizzes, cracks, and thumps everywhere, and your screen getting splattered with dirt.  The vehicles are relatively easy to operate, and help to save time--the first mission is actually timed, although not stated up front, and if you take too long, your helicopter will leave without you!  Unfortunately, with the bizarre AI, even having a vehicle with a machine gun doesn't help your cause, because your guys can't hit the broad side of a barn (I learned to just floor it when encountering enemies on the road).  And that second mission is nearly unforgiveable, designing a COVERT mission, then putting an extremely tight time limit on it (which throws stealth tactics right out the window), and not giving silenced weapons for the engagements you must undertake--as soon as you shoot, even Magoo knows exactly where you are!  Still, it has many redeeming qualities, and for $10 or less I'd recommend it for a decent shooter--I just had hoped for more out it.

I played to death the awesome SNES title, ""Yoshi's Island: Super Mario World 2"" and thought Yoshi's Story would be like that game. As a matter of fact, many gamers thought so as well but once we all played through it, we realized that while it was good, it is nothing like the SNES classic. And along with a few other issues, Yoshi's Story is great for the kids to play but for everyone expecting a sequel to Yoshi's Island, it turned out to be bad.

Yoshi's Story was released in 1998 and was considered to be the spiritual successor to Yoshi's Island. Baby Bowser wrecks havoc in Yoshi's Island so you must defeat him to make everything alright. You control 8 different colored versions of Yoshi, the lovable dinosaur where for each stage you must search out different kinds of fruit. Find them all and you complete the stage and move on through the 24 stages that are available. The game ends when you die using all 8 colored Yoshis and you must restart the stage again. After you are done with the Story mode, there's a Trial Mode (see how much of a high score you can get) and a Practice Mode (it's basically one level where you practice all of Yoshi's moves.)

The PROS: This game looked real good. The graphics are smooth, sharp and bright. The music is very cheery and fits the overall mood in Yoshi's Story while the sound effects are exactly what you expect to hear in this light hearted title. The controls are responsive so getting used to how Yoshi moves will be very easy. It's perfect for parents who have kids that are starting to discover and play video games.

The CONS: Those who are looking for the deep, action platforming action and challenging game play that Yoshi's Island brought to the SNES will be deeply, deeply saddened by what they find here. This game is BRUTALLY easy and just as you start to get into it, it's over. Yoshi's Story has 24 stages compared to the 50 stages plus 10 bonus stages featured in the SNES classic. The only thing you do in Yoshi's Island is eat fruit. There is no rescuing Baby Mario, no magical vehicle transformations, no red coins to collect or any incentive to achieve the 100% complete rating at the end of each stage other than to move to the next stage. Don't bother trying to unlock extra stages, modes, etc. because there is nothing there to begin with.

It took me 1 day to beat this game and after two more days, it was time for me to return it. I was disappointed that it was such a short and easy game. If you're a fan of Yoshi's Island, don't buy this thinking it's the sequel.

And I have to say it is pretty good, I probably spent a large portion of time in create a warrior. However one tremendous flaw is that costumes to start with are quite limited, and if you are like me, going to want to fabricate most of the Shin Sangoku Musou Blast characters (a mobile card game exclusive to japan featuring dynasty warriors characters that have yet to be playable including Liao Hua, Cheng Pu, Bianshi and Yuan Shu) or even other characters from Samurai Warriors and Vocaloid then you will have to fork over $10+. Which is completely and utterly unnecessary. As Capcom have shown with Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate the true purpose of dlc (content added to the game over the course of time to help prolong the games life with no asking price). And this'd not be a problem if the dlc in 8 empires were minimal but there's quite a slew of it for costumes, stages, music and more.

And visually this most certainly is not a PS4 game. I am completely uncertain why Koei did not make this a PS3 release (especially when I do not believe this game sold many copies either way). It looks very dated, even more then the recent Tales Of Zesteria. And 30 fps does not help matters much either. I do not fathom how you take a step backwards from 8 Xtreme Legends Complete Edition to this.

But beyond those 2 overwhelming faults, there is quite a bit of fun with the customization you can give to your character (especially facial features, movesets, weapon and build), army, horses, banner, and your own kingdoms ""story mode"" (or as close to one as your going to get). Building Relationships with other characters, marriage, conceiving & customizing your own child, bringing prosperity to the people of your kingdom as a benevolent leader or suffering like a dictator.

Nothing note worthy about core gameplay, it's all of what we have seen done in DW8 & 8XL, but that is fine because there are numerous ways to attack opponents unlike the PS2 installments of Dynasty Warriors. But in the way of strategy there is alot more adding to the fun, using cards in battle to make alterations to weather, summon large weapons to wreck havoc on enemy forces or use the field to your advantage and wait for a flood to wipe out the enemy forces, the possibilities are endless.

Xun Yu is an intriguing addition to this immense roster. Featuring a weapon unlike much of what we've seen in other Musou games that also involves some (minimal) thought process just like a strategist. I certainly hope he plays a big part of Wei's story in Dynasty Warriors 9 and brings in more scenarios that we haven't yet seen from RO3K. And then on top of that you get more new weapons for select characters. And flying around the stage with Sun Quans new flame sword was quite a bit of fun.

First off, the clamps to hold the steeringwheel to the desk are annoyingly designed. They are too small to grasp my desk firmly, and as such the wheel will come off during drifting, or heavy use on windy roads. This is absurdly annoying, and has ruined some of my sessions utterly.
 I let me step dad demo the wheel, who loves racing games and cars, and both the wheel and gearshift came loose on the first turn... Not a good demo..

Once you do get it clamped down tight, it's amazing. The level at which you can adjust the force feedback is great, so if you want a stiff wheel that simulates no powersteering, or a very loose wheel that reacts well to drifting and cornering, you can make it so.

The pedals work as they should, I feel the clutch pedal is too stiff, at least in my experience.
The gear shift is also very nice, and has the feel of a real short throw shifter.

I would recommend this wheel to anyone interested in taking their racing experience to the next wheel.","Awesome, Amazing",1389830400,,,

Basically, you play as one primary character with secondary and tertiary characters following you around.  The secondary character is fully customizable, and the tertiary character acts on their own.  With your party of three, you can use your skill upgrade system to develop your abilities and hot key them to the dual command bars on either side of the screen for super quick access.  You explore areas in a somewhat-""Diablo"" style of combat, but with a ""Children of Mana"" style of artwork and presentation.

All in all, it's a very customizable, very entertaining, excellent gameplay style game.  If you're a fan of Diablo and either Children of- or Secret of Mana, then you're going to like this game.

my absolute #1 gripe about this game is whoever was in charge of the controller layout needs to play call of duty for awhile. as most of you know wolfenstein is a FPS and as such the controller and button layout are critical. the gun selector absolutely sucks as quick changes may or may not be the weapon you want. the fire button and grenade are backwards using l2 and r2 for aim and fire. i can't count how many times i threw grenades meaning to fire a weapon by pressing r1.

this game did a lot right but seriously falls short with the controller input and how it effects gameplay. 99% of people are conditioned to a COD style button layout for FPS games and bethesda absolutely dropped the ball with their quirky input selection.

4.0,False,"05 26, 2008",A7P7ZBSC10APW,B0011BE3KA,ReelGuyTV,"In my opinion, the Silent Hill series began to fall with the third installment, but was completely annihilated with the fourth game - but in Origins...Silent Hill is resurrected from the dead and has this long dedicated fan salivating for more.

This time you play the role of truck driver Travis, whose persona has a lot in common with the memorable James Sunderland from the second game, as deep supressed and unwanted memories are forced out the more the haunted town claws its way into his soul. While Travis goes into this world of self discovery, you the player uncover the Origins of Silent Hill and see firsthand the separation of Alessa and Cheryl, and the birth of all the madness.

The exploratory element that the third game neglected to utilize is brought back in Silent Hill Origins. All the streets are there for you to explore. Other than the usual Twilight Zone scenery, its unfortunate, however, that there is not much to discover down the narrow alleys or at the end of each road like what we had with the second game (like a corpse clutching on to the page of his final journal entry, or another Bar Nelly's with a blood stained map and strange writing on the wall talking about disappearing holes). That bar alone from Silent Hill 2 caused mile-long discussion forums all over the internet. Them were the days....

But the streets are there to explore nonetheless, and to think that they were all absent in Silent Hill 4.

One of the other small gripes that I had with this title is that the monsters appeared too early. I prefer a slow agonizing descent into madness, getting more intense the deeper you explore. This was something Silent Hill 2 perfected with the walk through the woods; first it was strange sounds, then strage shadows, then tracks of blood....a good build up before you were even confronted with anything. Not so in this game.

I also think creatures should be stranger and more otherworldly, not bigger and more aggressive in a Silent Hill game. But that's just me.

And I'm tired of having ways to warp back and forth from world to world, which this game borrowed from Silent Hill 4 with its stupid tunnels. Was it not crazy enough when the whole world around you would physically Shape-Shift every time the fire Sirens screamed? This I personally believe Silent Hill 1 was best at (check my review for that game).

Those are my four biggest complaints. This is otherwise a very authentic Silent Hill game, and by the time you make it all the way to the Riverside Hotel, you will feel like you're playing Silent Hill 2 all over again. This game features four abandoned buildings to explore which include the Hospital (of course), a Sanatorium, an Amphitheater and the RiverSide Hotel. A couple smaller placeses include a General Store, a Butcher's Shop, a Lumber Yard and the Antique Shop (where the altar from the first game is). Its the small things that give the town a character of its own and that's important since its the town that keeps bringing players back.

When Silent Hill comes out for Next Generation, I expect mostly every vacant house and room open for exploration, with ghastly little surpises in each. One can only hope.

The single player campaign is fun and has a pretty epic climax, but every mission leading up to it kinda feels like foreplay.

The multiplayer is a joy to play, and I love the 3D movement abilities. You can zip around maps with ease. Titan combat is also fun, but the limited size of the maps can sometimes hurt gameplay. Maps are generally filled with corridors that only can fit about one Titan through. This leads to some pile ups and chaos, and I feel that more fun might be had with some more open spaces in which to do combat.

4.0,False,"01 16, 2011",A33ZR6EK5FVAMJ,B0030MOTNE,Andrew T. Bedgood,"I was born six years after the first TRON movie hit theatres, so I wasn't able to enjoy the fantastic digital world presented in that Disney flick when it was initially released; I did, however, get to view it when it aired on the Disney Channel sometime around the 20th anniversary. I think I was 13 at that time and I had seen better movies with far better visual effects, art direction, and writing--but there was something oddly alluring about the dated picture that pulled me in and kept me fascinated with the world of the programs and their struggle for liberation from the MCP (Master Control Program) and their belief in the Users. It was a movie that didn't attempt profound storytelling, favoring flair and fun over meaningful messages (although one could argue that the flick had dealt with corporate corruption or the dangers of technological advancement, just as one could argue that it had strong religious meanings with the programs looking to Kevin Flynn, the User, for salvation--it, like any piece of fiction, is really up to the viewer to determine the meaning and, for me, it was just a fun movie).

TRON is a franchise heavily rooted in videogame references and has a history of successful videogames (fun fact: the original TRON arcade cabinet was a bigger success than the film upon which it was based (you can get the original arcade game on XBLA, but I wouldn't recommend it because it is pretty wonky with a standard controller)). Following the 20th anniversary of the film, Disney had Monolith develop TRON 2.0 in an attempt to get the franchise some more footing to see if a film sequel would be a wise decision at that point and, while TRON 2.0 was a critical success (it's an awesome game, btw, so if you haven't played it, check it out--even if it's no longer considered canon), it was a financial disappointment and the franchise faded back into its cult status and obscurity. It wasn't until 2008 that the franchise would get back into the spotlight with a dazzling Comic-Con teaser that was met with thunderous applause and rabid fanboyish excitement (I wasn't there to experience it, but I had a pretty hardcore nerd-spasm when I heard about it and watched the crappy shaky-cam footage on youtube). The positive reception of the teaser led to the green-lighting of the film and two years later we got the absolutely awesome TRON: Legacy (I loved Legacy and think it's a marvel to watch with a fantastic soundtrack--critics be damned!).

With TRON: Legacy released and Disney hoping to reestablish the franchise as a moneymaking behemoth, there is, of course, a game tie-in, TRON: Evolution. I was a bit wary when it was announced because it has the stigma of being a movie-game with the development cycle tied to being completed by the time the film comes out--I knew I was going to play it because I'm a major TRON geek, but I braced myself to be disappointed with ugly visuals, broken gameplay, and a substandard story. Disney's own Propaganda Games taking the helm of this game and that was the another warning sign for me since they're a studio with only one game under their belt (the lackluster Turok reboot). However, while I will make no claims that this is a great game or a game of the year contender, it is by no stretch of the imagination a ""bad"" game.

TRON: Evolution does away with the first-person gameplay of Monolith's 2.0 and favors, instead, a Prince of Persia-esqe platforming system. It doesn't really have the brain-teasing puzzles that are present in a PoP game, but there's an abundance of wall running and death-defying jumps. Level exploration is linear with a defined ""point A to point B"" structure of progression, but the environments are vast and there's plenty of combat to keep you occupied on your journey. The platforming works fine and I honestly found it to be more enjoyable and fluid that the most recent installment in the PoP series (The Forgotten Sands).

Adding variety to the game's progression are the light cycle and light tank scenarios--while it would be easy to complain about how heavily scripted these scenes are or how disappointing it is that it's basically a race to get to the next area with no frills, I found both of them to be enjoyable and a much needed distraction from the platforming (as I said, the platforming works fine, but there's no real puzzles to speak of, so the variety added here is essential). The light cycle sequences aren't really anything to write home about and consist of you driving forward on a predetermined path while avoiding explosions, derezzing environments, and other programs on light cycles--it's heavily scripted and not innovative in any way, but I found it to be fun with some heart pounding intensity as I raced toward my destination desperately dodging foes determined to derez me. It's the kind of videogame sequence that's fun for the first time, but more predictable with each subsequent playthrough. The light tank sequences are similarly structured on a predetermined path with scripted enemies and such, but they evoke nostalgia as they are obviously heavily inspired by Space Paranoids (an arcade game created by Kevin Flynn and seen in action in the first movie, for those of you who don't know). A good comparison would be the Metropolis level in HALO 2 where you have to get across the bridge in the Scorpion as Banshees and Ghosts try to take you out--the light tank sequences in Evolution have you blasting through Recognizers and the armies of CLU to reach the end of the scenario. Again, it's nothing spectacular or original, but the variety is a benefit, it works well, and I found it to be enjoyable as both a gameplay element and a nod to the original fiction.

Combat in the game has you using your Identity Disc to dispatch foes through a blend of melee and ranged attacks. As your character upgrades to higher versions (ie. levels up), more combos and disc upgrades become available to assist you in derezzing enemies. Combat works well if you're not a rabid button masher, there's a needed finesse to pulling off a proper combo and constantly just tapping buttons in hopes to progress beyond the combat scenario is going to end in tragedy for you, program. The array of attacks that you can unlock become more flashy and (T-rated appropriate) brutal--the game is, however, lacking a finishing move (unless I was just doing something wrong) with downed enemies. I think it'd be neat if you kneel over your downed enemies and land a derez-dealing blow with your Identity Disc, but that seems to be nonexistent.

Graphically, I found Evolution to be hypnotically beautiful. It uses the same visual style as the new film (which some might find odd considering it takes place during the time of Flynn's disappearance, but you have to remember that this is a new system created after the MCP and the same system Sam is pulled into--so, really, it makes sense), so the environments have a futuristic black and blue sheen that some may find bland and barren, but I love the look of the movie and, therefore, the game. So, the armour and environments all look great; some of the faces, however, could have used a little more loving attention as they come off creepy and robotic. Character animations are fluid and refined, however some combat and platforming strings have an unwanted jerkiness to them--it doesn't break the game but it could/should have been ironed out. Regardless of those complaints, Evolution looks like a highly polished game with high production values and a beautiful visual style.

TRON: Evolution's story takes place in between the two films and chronicles the disappearance of Flynn and TRON as well as CLU's uprising. I won't delve into details in case you haven't seen Legacy, but Flynn's been gone since '89, CLU (which is really CLU 2.0 since the original was derezzed by the MCP in the first movie) betrayed his maker, and TRON stayed to fight CLU and his minions so that Flynn could escape--he hasn't been seen since and is presumed dead. The story isn't a Shakespearian masterpiece, nor does it try to be, it's more of the ""here to be fun"" kind of storytelling that is common to the franchise, but it does well to expand the universe and gives fans like myself something to talk about and geek over. I don't need my TRON story to be filled with allegories and meanings, I need it to be fun and expand the fiction that I know and love, and Evolution succeeds in that task.

Evolution's soundtrack is strong with a cast of talented actors bringing the story to life and a booming score that does a fantastic job of accenting the action--the score can easily stand on its own as a great addition to the TRON music-verse but it's made even more memorable by the two Daft Punk tracks that are included. The cast of actors carry their roles well with Bruce Boxleitner and Olivia Wilde reprising their big-screen roles of TRON and Quorra respectively; Jensen Ackles of Supernatural fame lends his voice to Gibson; Fred Tatasciore takes over the roles of Kevin Flynn and CLU and does a fine job sounding like the Oscar winning actor who made those characters who they are; and, of course, Nolan North plays a voice role. It's not going to win any awards, but the cast all do a fine job bringing their characters to life and making the world presented more believable.

With all that said, you must be wondering how long Evolution can keep you engaged, right? Well, Evolution employs RPG elements to improve your character and your version continues to grow in both the single-player campaign as well as the online modes. There are a total of 50 versions (character levels) at the point of this writing and the game features downloadable content to expand the experience (which will likely be restricted to online maps). There's also an unlockable difficulty beyond the three you can choose to play when you first pop the game in. Evolution's campaign consists of seven chapters that can take you anywhere between 6-15 hours to play (it all really depends on what difficulty you play on--if you play on easy, you can zip right through (provided you actually know how to play games), if you play on hard or insane, it's going to take you a bit more time to get through the game's challenges). If you're a fan of the TRON universe, you'll likely be more inclined to replay the campaign multiple times; for the rest of you, it's likely to be a ""one and done"" sort of deal and you'll be better off sticking with a rental instead of purchasing the game. There are also collectibles scattered throughout the environments that completionists and fans will spend extra time seeking out to gain the achievements or more insight to the world of TRON and the game's story.

There's probably going to be a lot of guff about this review since I actually liked the game and so many people are predisposed to hate it since it's a movie licensed title or the ""real"" critics gave it abysmal to mediocre reviews, but I stand by my beliefs. TRON: Evolution may not be truly innovative in any sense, but it provides plenty of content that I found to be a joy to play, an excellent soundtrack, beautiful visuals, and enough TRON fiction to keep the fans happy for the time it takes for the next film or game installment to be released. Evolution is by no means a great game, and I won't declare that it is, but it is a good game--the mechanics work the way they should with fast-paced, fluid gameplay in beautiful environments with a strong cast and awesome musical score.

I really would like to see them continue the game series independent of the inevitable film sequels to allow the developers more time to add more features and functionality to the games. I would love to see some free-roaming exploration added to the game on top of the action/platforming already in there as well as a BioWare-esque conversation system--just imagine how awesome it would be to truly explore the world of TRON and be able to interact with other programs and fight for the Users or become a rogue program that is a hazard to the system. That kind of freedom would be an awesome addition to the franchise.

This is a game about a dark witch who uses her hair, HER HAIR, to summon demons from the dark abiss to vanquish (EVIL?) angels who seek to smite out the darkness completely and unbalance the entire world...

NEVERMIND. It does not matter.

What matters is that the game is fun. It has REALLY good action, REALLY good controls, and REALLY interesting level design. THis come from the same guy who made Devil May Cry, and it showes. The combat is nearly identical, the combos are almost word-for-word the same, and it is a good thing. Also, you are playing a long-legged woman wearing tight clothes that almost completely dissapear when she uses her boss-sized hair demons.

Stop drooling.

The game has EVIDENT sex appeal, the creators blatantly admitting that they tried to make the character more attractive to men. Hey, if it sells games, right?

Other than the sexism, the game is really good. I could see a woman playing this if she has a relaxed view on genders. If a girl can see this a a strong woman comfortable being sexual around guy characters then thumbs up for her. She can enjoy this game without being offended.

The real problem with it is not in the hardware, but in the game itself. You'll find that the disc only has 63 songs with keys out of the 83, and at least 6 of those 63 tracks aren't really worth playing, unless you enjoy hitting 5 notes and then playing nothing for half the song. The songs that do have a reasonable amount of keys, however, are incredibly fun on both standard and pro, and certainly makes the purchase worthwhile. Additionally, downloadable songs will come with keyboard parts when there is one in the song, so you'll quickly be able to add to the small library of key songs.

The pro keyboard mode works very nicely, offering a nice extra challenge on top of the standard instruments for those who want it, and you may even learn a few things from doing it. My only complaint here being that, in practice mode, you can only slow down to 60%, which is still to fast to properly learn some of the more complex songs like Roundabout.

Anyone familiar with the Bioshock series should know what to expect graphically, and this game does not disappoint.  It is a *gorgeous* game.  Certain gameplay elements of the first two games remained, particularly the ""vending machine"" concept.  There is also a fair amount of handholding in this game, as you are given specific objectives and have a handy virtual arrow that will send you in the right direction whenever you need it to (although there are a couple of times that the arrow won't tell you to leave a situation when you have to in order to advance the story).

The ""hacking"" element of the first two games is notably missing.  When faced with an automated foe, previous versions allowed you to try and hack it, but your options in this game are to either use a ""vigor"" (a super-power) to temporarily possess it or simply get to shooting.  And, unlike its predecessors, this version doesn't have you face one particular foe (like a Big Daddy) every so often.

It's all very subjective as to how the game actually compares with the previous versions.  Personally, I preferred the underwater world of Rapture and felt the characters were better developed in the first two games, but that's simply a preference and many folks wouldn't agree.

My one grievance with the game is that I felt a bit suckered by the vigor situation.  In the vast majority of the game, vigors were a convenience, but I rarely encountered anything that couldn't be resolved with firearms.  So, I would spend my very-limited income upping my firepower.  SPOILER ALERT!!!!:::: And that served me fine until the big final battle, at which point vigors are (at least, to a player of my skill level) critical to keep the baddies from defeating the ""defend"" objective (in other words, you can keep yourself alive, but that will do you no good if you don't have the vigors to repel your enemies from that which you are defending), lest you lose a war of attrition.  And, to further twist the knife, you don't realize this until you are (without any warning from the game that I can recall) at a point of no return with no access to vending machines to correct this deficiency.  This creates a spike in difficulty that finally resulted in me simply reducing the difficulty level (painful to do at the end of a game) so I could at least see the ending.  And that soured the experience for me a bit.

As to the story, particularly the ending, opinions vary wildly, so I'll just call it ""ambitious.""  I hit the Internet to really understand what I had watched and liked it much better when I read explanations of what happened.  Then again, it would have been more fun at the time had it made sense as I was seeing it, but again... ""ambitious.""

So, is it an improvement?  It's hard to say.  Is it a game worth playing?  Certainly, if you like FPS.  The atmosphere alone is unique enough to warrant a playthrough, there is some variety in the weaponry and vigors (dang vigors!) and the character of Elizabeth is one of the best non-player characters I've ever seen.  So if your hopes aren't too high, you'll find something to enjoy here.","Good, but not great",1392854400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

Rather than jamming 1k cars into the disk (with 800 of them being generic, bare bones in detail), it goes for a tenth of that and delivers nothing but premium cars. So if you're the type of person that prefers quantity over quality, you will be severely underwhelmed with this game's roster of super model cars. Also, this new GT is primarily online-based. In fact, on the cover of the box is specifically says, ""internet required for most functionality."" So if the campaign is something you care most about with GT and you're a casual fan that doesn't care for the online component, save your money because this game is definitely not for you. If you don't care about either of the aforementioned ways this game differs from the rest in the series, you will enjoy this title. The gameplay is amazing and the graphics are gorgeous. Also, there's this new DR/SR ranking system that they implemented to discourage driving like an a*****e. Admittedly, at first I hated it (my initial thought being ""I don't wan't someone telling me how fast to drive or what cars I can't hit""). But after playing this game every day since it came out, I got over it. PD doesn't want people doing the most to screw others over, they want a clean driving experience for everyone. This isn't Mario Kart or Modnation Racers. I'm a D/C rank and I can truly say that it isn't bumper cars where I'm at. So if you're the type of person who likes to bump your way to victory, this game isn't for you (unless you're willing to be placed with other drivers like you, which I can't imagine would be fun). This game is definitely a good start and it will absolutely grow considering PD takes its time between launches, but unless you're a hardcore, competitive GT fan, GT Sport won't be for you. Also, if you plan on buying it, spend the extra $10 and get the LE. You get so much more content.

The tactical aspects of this game are rather shallow, but then I cut my teeth on Close Combat III and the tabletop wargames of the pre-windows era. Still, the battles are fun and there is room to give yourself an edge through contrivance or cleverness. The roleplaying aspect is, again, rather shallow from my perspective but I'm an old school D&D gamer. Both aspects might be described with kinder words than ""shallow"" and it's likely the gentle grade of the learning curve which is conducive to the pure addictive fun of the game. I would have to say that one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game is the colorfull dialogue and interraction with the NPC's encountered. The NPC's, their stories and dillemna's are all interresting and imaginitive. You'll have ""good fun"" beating the bushes for solutions.

Are there drawbacks to this game? Yes, quality troops aren't replenished from the supply pools often enough and in one area of the map you'll have a hard time finding magic using troops of any description although your foes will not. This certainly cuts down on your options and may limit you towards dependance upon the ""human wave"" tactics favored by U.S.Grant as well as North Korean and Chinese commanders.

Perfect Dark Zero keeps a lot of what made the first game as fun as it was, so if you are a retuning fan you should get some enjoyment out of it, as I did.

The graphic style is pretty slick. It's more of a stylized animation style rather than a more realistic one, but there are hint here and there that we indeed have seen some of what we can expect from other next generation games such as bricks on buildings actually having depth. One thing about the graphics is that the lighting makes a lot of things look shiny or like they are wet...even things such as wood..which is a little odd.

The story line is pretty weak. No need on really paying too much attention to it..just follow the objectives and try not to get annoyed by the bad voice acting...espectially by Chandra..who helps you remotely throughout the game. The game play is pretty solid, though there is somewhat of a learning curve to how weapons function.

There is one thing about this title that bothers me a lot. The fact that the game is pretty glitchy. You will experience unexplained freezes..which seems to happen more when going from one game mode to another. Another glitch I've noticed happens in the game itself.

Philbert,"Freetime allows your sims to have hobbies such as Tinkering, Science, Nature, Arts & Carfts, Film & Theatre, Nature, Sports, Gaming, Cuisine.  Once your sim reaches the half way point of mastering these hobbies it opens up a secret lot where your sim  can perfect these hobbies.  If your sims is into to cuisine a secret lot will open up that allows them to enter a food contest. Also your sims can earn membership into a hobby club once they reach this half point in there hobby skill level. Once they master a hobby then your sims will be in the zone.  When your sim is in the zone they glow and their motive meter decreases alot slower which allows them to participate in this hobby a lot longer.

Freetime also offers new interactions like birdwatching, bug hunting, sing nursery rhymes (which sounds funny), watching movies, blogging about your hobby on the computer, browsing the web about your hobby, reading about your hobby in the newspaper, etc.  It also adds a new study skill called parenting which allows your sims once they have earned this skill pick up on your sim's baby needs lowest motives and try to fulfill it. Which takes the guess work of trying to do everything for a screaming baby when you can't see their needs meter.

Freetime also offers new furniture such as a new microwave, stove, toaster, dishwasher, trash compacter, etc. that are different colors.  Other furniture options include new baby furniture. The is what I love because the new baby furniture is a lot nicer and elegant. Other furniture include sports or hobby related items such as basketball court, soccer, ballet barre, sports rugs, picture frames, desk supplies, painting supplies, pottery making machine, sewing machine, restorable car,etc. Some new lots which include Nerissa's clothing store, Freetime Recreation Center, and two other homes.

Sims can now have a secondary aspiration as well.  They can also earn aspiration benefits which will allow them the benefit of for example to beg for there job back if they were fired or have there hunger & energy meter decay slower.  Overall I feel like the sims 2 life is so complete right now. I could not imagine another expansion pack being added on to the ones I already have because there is sooo much to do as it is.

Having established that I'll give my objective review.

__Single Player__
The loading screen was clever, and wasn't as long as people complained about.
First starting off the game -- before the title screen even came up -- is interesting and a bit confusing at first. But when I hit the ""X"" button the ""channel"" changed; it's then that I realized what it was supposed to be. So I surfed these channels for a bit until the main title came up. They were hilarious and just amazing to watch in their brillant colors/graphics and clarity. I happened across a parody of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" where the lady had to identify one of the PMCs. Heh, there was even a cooking show that was cooking up snakes in a bunker.

The game then began, credits rolling over the occaisional cutscene still. Interesting to watch, but I was glad that I got caught up on my MGS before starting. I could see where someone picking up this title with no previous knowledge would become confused real quick. (Thank goodness there's a recently released MG Database!)

Gameplay is fun, especially adapting to your surroundings with Octocamo. It does take some getting used to, but it's basically 3rd person with the ability to shoot over-the-shoulder or in first person down the sights (ironsights, rail, red-dot, scope). Customization is huge. And very fluid after you bump into ""Drebin"" and begin utilizing the Drebin points system. I like how this was utilized. Sell off weapons that you can't use because of their ID tags (future tech disables other users) and then use the credits toward purchases of mods. Take your M4 and utilize the rails for a laser sight or Master Key. The environments in general look great and looking down the weapon sight has that realistic feel to it.

I like how they incorporated the iPod into your inventory, definitely some potential there.

__Multiplayer: Metal Gear Online__
This was utilized quite nicely. The only gripe I have is that you have to register for a Konami name, then a Game ID. Which can't match. Seems redundant, until you realize you can have multiple Game IDs to each Konami name. The first character you create is free. Customize your PMC soldier however you wish.
The Drebin Points are utilized differently, instead of picking up weapons, it's based off of kills, captures, achievements (Knock an enemy out and gain some points, # of headshots, etc.). Then upon your respawn, customize your inventory up to the amount of points you snagged, or retain them until the next time for even better weapons.

The controls are the same (Items/Weapons, 3rd person, over-the-shoulder, and first person) and there's a nice tutorial that you can go through to get you up to speed.

You can also customize your abilities. And the best part is that they're not ""locked."" You can change them inbetween matches so that you're increasing the stats on each one. You have your choice of 4 abilities, choose from all sorts of categories; from CQC, Knife Mastery, Sniper, Assault, ""Trickery"" and even some of the SOP specials. The SOP allows for teamwork on the network, utilized through the nanomachines, allowing for you to know where everyone is, and if they're under fire or perhaps just knocked out. The more you use an ability, the closer you'll get to advancing it to the next tier/level of mastery.

Definitely a lot of fun; looking forward to advancing the skill sets.
And definitely recommend MGO for gamers looking to play online, advance in skill, and utilize teamwork.

__Overall__
Definitely fun, and looks great. A great stealth title, plus a fun online experience for you and some friends.

At its heart, this is a pretty basic platforming-and-brawling game. (If you have some history with videogames, think of this as about 50%&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gauntlet/dp/B00000K2GI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gauntlet</a>, 50%&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ratchet-Clank/dp/B000UC5ML0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ratchet & Clank</a>.) But it's anything but your typical licensed-property game that feels like it's been thrown together; it's really solid. The levels are well-designed. There's lots of variety in the gameplay and the settings. And the writing is top-notch; it's accessible to kids while still engaging for the grownups as well.

There are only two reasons why I haven't given this game five stars (and I was really tempted to). One is that it is, quite definitely, an excuse to sell little figurines... and when you play it, you will see that that's quite definitely built into the game's design. In particular, the fact that the figures fall into eight ""elemental types"" -- and that each area of the game gives an advantage to one elemental type -- means that there's an obvious advantage to having one figure of each type, so that you'll have a character in the game that matches every type advantage. Since the game comes with three figures, that means that you'll have five types left to cover. So you can expect your little ones to plead until you buy at least five more figures. So you'll want to budget accordingly, and that makes the game rather expensive.

The other is that you have to understand that the Portal -- the platform that plugs into the console, that you set the figures on -- is as much a part of the control scheme as the controller. When you decide that it's time to switch characters, you don't do it by just pushing a few buttons; you do that by physically switching figures -- taking the old one off the Portal and putting the new one on. And if you want to play the game well, you'll be switching characters a lot. That means that you'd better have a table nearby, so that you can have the Portal and all your figures lined up in easy reach while you play. If your game room doesn't allow for this, or if it just sounds annoying to you, you may not want to buy.

Ahem.....

Is this a perfect game? No. After all it's a hack and slash game and those games, while good, are not perfect.  But I don't think the game deserved a zero score on some sites.  I take offense of the people that rated this game a score of 2's and zero's.  I grew up in the era of the Atari 2600 and I know what a zero game looks like and this game isn't one of those by a long shot.

The story is thin and boring just like most hack and slash games.  The entire point of a game is the gameplay. You can have a game where the story is on par with Paradise Lost but if the gameplay is lackluster it won't receive a high score.  The gameplay of DMC is all about stringing together crazy combos and getting unique weapons after you defeat a boss.

Is this better than the original game?  Yes and no.  The old Dante was a cool dude but not very deep...The new Dante is a jerk teenager. The writing is lazy in both games, especially in this game.  This has much better graphics and action.

After reading good player reviews from people who loved Sims 2 as much as I do, I decided to give it a chance, and after playing it a couple of days, I like it a lot.

CONS:
The camera is hard to control.  You can set it to use Sims 3 controls, which helps a little. I'm getting used to it but it should be better.

Interiors of houses are far too dark. I solved this by putting three lights in each room instead of one.

Lots are surprisingly small. I am not a builder, but I know this is disappointing for builders and I hope bigger lots will be available eventually.

There are hardly any service Sims. I want firefighters to put out fires and cops to catch burglars (who aren't in the game right now, either). There is a system to hire town residents to do certain things, but it seems wonky. The caterer at my Sim wedding served food but did not provide a wedding cake. Shouldn't she have?

Teens, young adults, and adults look alike and are the same height. I actually can identify teens by sight so far (not sure why, maybe they have a slighter build), but young adults and adults appear identical and seem to play identically, which makes me wonder why young adults are in the game at all (there's no university yet).  The young adult lifespan seems too long relative to the adult lifespan. This could be corrected by adding a middle-age life stage-- or even changing adult to middle age?

Hardly any places to visit. No restaurants, for example. I am sure venues will be added later.

Furniture choices so far are bland.

CHANGES I DON'T MIND TOO MUCH:
I don't mind the lack of an open world since I am a fan of Sims 2, which doesn't have it. And in Sims 4 you CAN follow your Sim around the neighborhood -- jogging, for instance -- and stop to chat with passers-by. This is nice.

It's too bad toddlers didn't make it into the game. They were very cute and well done in Sims 2, but that life stage had little real impact on the game. If it's brought back in Sims 4 I'd like it to be meaningful. Maybe well-brought up toddlers get an extra trait -- that would make it worth the effort in gameplay terms.

Pools - a weird omission given how iconic it is to drown Sims, but I never drowned any so I can do without pools for now.

Sims 3 players complain about the loading screens in Sims 4, but they are quick and don't bother me.

You have to fix items yourself or replace them, no repairman. This sounds bad but I'm kind of liking it because it adds to the challenge of gameplay. My Sims are trying to save money to move so they fix everything. As they improve in repair ability, they can upgrade appliances so they break less often. I find this interesting, but repairmen should still be an option.

Many items can't be purchased till they're unlocked via career promotions. Again, I like this because it makes the game more challenging.

PROS:
All new animations. When I played Sims 3 I saw the same animations as Sims 2, but in Sims 4 everything I see is new, which makes it fun to watch. It should be that way in every new Sims game.

No rabbit holes, yay! If my Sim is going into a building, I want to go in too, not sit staring at the exterior of the building as in Sims 3.

The multitasking is just as great as everyone says -- Sims can watch TV, eat, and hold a conversation at the same time. In game play this is a lot cooler than it sounds, quite realistic and a big time saver.

I also like the emotions system. It is easily managed if you want to play that way but also adds to unpredictability if you like to be surprised. One of my Sims almost had his wedding ruined when he lost his temper at a quarrelsome guest! I managed to cheer him up before he said his vows. It's nice to know that every party or event won't play out the same way every time.

Walk styles -- yes, they are goofy, but they fit into the whimsy of the Sim world, and also they help differentiate Sims from each other. I'm glad the Sims series still has a sense of humor.

So far I've had only one minor bug and no crashes. The game runs smoothly. Quite different from the Sims 3 base game, which crashed so much that I was afraid it would damage my computer.

Little touches mean a lot. When the Sims play ""Sims Forever"" on their computers, it looks like The Sims 1. That was fun to see. The TV shows are well done, too. Attention to detail shows that someone in charge of creating this game still cares about it.

When I first began playing Sims 4 I wasn't sure how I felt about it, but it grew on me over a couple of days. When I started laughing in pleasant surprise at things that were happening in the game, I knew it had won me over. I still think it costs too much -- EA admits this is a ""base game,"" and since it's not a full game I believe it shouldn't be so pricy. But I'm not sorry I bought it.

As earlier reviews have pointed out, this game is not for the faint of heart. The story concerns Harry, an average man who comes to the small town of Silent Hill, a town with a scarred history. He is on vacation with his daughter, Cheryl, and on their way, there is an accident. When Harry comes to, he finds himself alone, his daughter missing. Add to this, the town is deserted. As you might expect, there are dangerous monsters lurking about. The purpose of this game is to find Harry's daughter and unlock the secrets of Silent Hill's past. It won't be easy, though.
""Silent Hill"" is better than RE in that it provides much more realism. Harry is an average person like you or me, not a hero or arsenal on two legs. Like most humans, he is not an expert at conflict, so this makes the battles much tougher. The atmosphere is where this game reallt excells. The deserted town is creepier than anything out of a horror movie, with fog so thick that you cannot see 10 feet in front of you. The snow falls steadily. The music is subtle, adding to the creepiness. The monsters come out of nowhere, and there are many occasions that will make you jump.
There is less action than the other survival horror games, but in a game like this, it is not a big loss. The game is more about solving puzzles than blowing monsters into oblivion. Unlike RPGs, there are no  experiece points, no levils, no benefit to fighting every single creature. Running from fights is often the best move.
The one big flaw, which prevents this game from getting five stars, is the clunky controls. I pity the person who plays this game without the analog joysticks. Harry is very difficult to move around, thanks to the complicated control system. It takes a while to get used to them, but by that time you will have gotten killed a few times. The monsters come out of nowhere, and you have mere seconds to react. With controls this complicated, battles are really frustrating.
But all in all, this is a fantastic game. Lots of depth, thrills, and scares. Sadly, this title is out of print, so grab it if you can find it. But it comes with a warning, it is violent and disturbing. Use with caution.",A nightmare you will want to stay awake for!,1005696000,,,

You get to customize your own singer (which is part of the fun; I got mine to look almost exactly like me) as well as the option to design the stages and venues where you sing. The game has a mixer-type set up which gives you the options to increase or decrease the volume of the music, the crowd, the singers' voices and player's voice separately. The game doesn't require that you sing perfectly to get points; just that you hit the right pitch. There are co-op and competition duets for two players. If you are not in the mood to play for points, there is a karaoke mode that simply shows the complete song verses (instead of the scrolling words on the bottom in regular game mode) on the screen to sing along with just like a traditional karaoke song video. It is definitely more fun to play the more people there are. The only downside is the song selection; while my wife and I are bilingual and liked a couple of the Spanish songs that were featured, the others were not all that exciting. Plus, most of the songs from the 70's and 60's were downright boring. The DLC content from XBL consists of only about 10 or 11 additional songs. All-in-all, we have no interest in about half of the songs. I realise it's hard to create a song line-up that pleases everyone when releasing a game that is meant to appeal to the general public, but that's why they should've had more DLC songs available like with the KRAI & DDR games. Still, this is a fun game especially if you are a karaoke fan.
Just a word of caution as a side note, especially to all those who think 'karaoke game = kids/ family game': you may want to review the song list (which can be found on Wiki) before buying as there are several songs based on overtly sexual themes. For that reason, along with some light profanity, it is rated T for teen.",Fun karaoke game but with limited song selection,1278720000,30,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Lin,"Certainly everyone is entitled to their own opinions, however nearly all these negative 1 star reviews are about not being able to play the game at all or very very little due to server issues and log-in issues...basically just things on SquareEnix's side of things, and not about the actual game which these reviews are for.

There are a few things that needs to be addressed. SE just did NOT plan this out like they should have, with a recent merge between the EU and NA databases they are having problem after problem with customer service issues and account issues, and basic website issues. Yes, they did have 4 phases of beta testing, but you have to understand...Phase 1-3 were closed beta testing, and in phase 4 when it was open testing, that was when most of the problems came out. They just didn't plan for phase 4 to be long enough (it was only 3 days), then with the game launching and being available now to anyone, it's not all that hard to understand that servers will be down/full.
Some people say that they are not lifting the limitations for the amount of players in a server, but I don't see how you have any way to know that. SE may have poor customer service, but they are really good at keeping everyone up to date in their forums. Very fast and getting maintenance in game to fix some issues, and try to be honest with the player. Sometimes they do put limitations on just to ensure things are working again, but they do try to lift that limitation slowly.
They have so many servers up already, and per server they're trying to have 5000 players on simultaneously. But with all this hype before the official launch with pre-ordering or people getting ready to play the game after it did get launched, and considering how many people are in Europe and North America combined, it's no surprise that they're full.

Maybe I'm just lucky that I have been able to play the game mostly with no trouble at all. Sure I sometimes get the issue of not being able to log in because of a full server, but I mostly am able to get on 10min later.

So yeah, I think most people are right about it, and they should have definitely spent more time with beta test phase 4 before launch.
But for my stars, it's for the actual game.

PS3 Player

I for one actually do really love the game. It's the second MMO I've ever played (the first being Runescape many years ago before it got better) so somethings I'm not so sure about but for the most part, they make it super easy even for a beginner.
The graphics and music is seriously awesome that of course goes perfect with the FF franchise.
I'm usually very impatient so to me once you reach past level 15, leveling up seems to take too long for me, but it's actually pretty easy. It's a game that most times I end up playing 3-4 hours at a time if I do have the time, and sometimes just playing for 30min is great. Also the attacks are very pretty and colorful, and I really do enjoy it quite much. It's very addicting.

I agree with a lot of the reviewers out there that the game should be set up to where they kick players off after a certain amount of time (once I played around 3 hours, and noticed one player in the exact same place/position the entire time before I logged in, and after I logged out, so they were obviously AFK)

My main complaint for the PS3 version is that I can't read the dialogue, so I'm not able to follow the story line even though I would like to. I have a pretty large tv, but even then I have to really stare at it and take my time to read the dialogue (the ones without voice acting), sometimes to the point where I have to guess at certain words. They have been able to fix it a little in the beta testing where the dialogue was actually cut off the screen, just the font size is still puny.
This also goes for any of the pop-ups when you try to read info on different items, your journal where you read about your quests, and just any general informational pop-up.
Another thing for me that I don't like on the PS3 is being able to click around...you would hit the select button and that jumps the cursor around to like your duty list, or the chat box or whatever, and if you pass something on accident, you have to circle back around. Otherwise, you have to know how to pull up the cursor itself (L1 + R3) and move it that when, then once you've deselected everything do L1 + R3 again to exit out of the cursor.

A lot of people say don't waste your money on this game, but I say if you're interested then just get it. It's an MMO, it'll be updated and fixed constantly...and just continue to get better. Whether you buy it now or just later on when they may have gotten some of the issued dealt with is up to you.

That said, a wonderful puzzle game with good action, PLENTY of sidequests, difficult enemies, and lots of fun as well.  The second playing, I finished in about half the time (I knew what I was doing), got 98 of 100 beads, unlocked all the specials, got the expensive items/weapons, fed most of the animals, and having met people 2 or three times in order to do the above, really became attached to even the minor ppl so that when that scene came that they were showing all the folks praying to Okami I had tears streaming down my face.

If you've read any of my other reviews, you will know that I'm a huge fan of First Person Shooter type games or FPS. That being the fact, I've played many dozens of FPS type games on various platforms. In order for an FPS type game to get a perfect score, it has to excel on numerous fronts. It needs to have decent graphics, tons of different weapons, numerous unique and non-repetitive levels, smart enemy A.I. and a decent amount of game playability.

Well folks, XIII or Thirteen is such a game. Imagine taking a spy thriller type comic book and turning it into a video game. That's exactly what the programmers at Ubisoft have created. Don't be put off by the ""comic"" looking graphics. Doing so will cause you to miss a really awesome game. I know, because that's exactly what I did. Until a friend of mine told me that I just had to play this game. So, I put my prejudice against ""comic"" graphics aside and played the game. I'm so glad I did!

Once I got into it, I was hooked until I couldn't stop playing! It's awesome how the ""comic book"" references are thoughtfully put into the game. Things like shooting a bad guy at the top of a cliff and then watching the words ""Ahhhh!!!"" come up in a balloon as he plummets to the ground. Just like it would in a real comic book!

All ""comics"" aside, once you really start playing the game you just forget about the cartoon like graphics and start blasting away at the bad guys. You get to shoot over 15 different weapons (knife, 9mm pistol, grenades, .44 special, double-barrel and pump-action shotguns, harpoon launcher (yes, there's an underwater level), crossbows (nothing like headshots from long distance with this one), mini gun (think Uzi), kalash (think AK47), assault rifle (with grenade launcher), machine gun (so heavy, it actually slows you down), bazooka (a FPS game without a bazooka is not a FPS game!), sniper rifle (again, what good FPS would be complete without a sniper rifle!). And you can also use chairs, brooms, bottles, ashtrays and other objects as weapons. The latter weapons will become a necessity during the ""stealth"" mode levels of the game.

All of the levels are very diverse and take place in various locations, everything from sandy beaches and wooded forests to icy, snowy mountains. As you play the game, various pieces of a conspiracy involving a presidential assassination begin to unravel. Although, you yourself have amnesia and are trying to figure out whom you are as well.

There are a total of about 8 different boss fights that you have to defeat to continue in the game. Luckily the checkpoints are thoughtfully laid out so that you won't have to cover too much repetitive ground if you should die the first few times. Some of the boss fights were easier than others, but they were all enjoyable.

There is also a 4-player split-screen multiplayer mode that includes deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag. You can also play deathmatch by yourself, since the game designers thoughtfully added some ""bots"" to play with you during deathmatch.

XII Thirteen is rated ""M"" for Mature. Like most FPS type games, there is a TON of blood and intense violence. This game is all about shooting and killing people and blowing things up. Which is the case with most FPS type games. If that's what floats your boat, then get a copy of this game! It was totally awesome, all the way to the very end? The music soundtrack was also very fitting to the game.

There were many instances where a map and directions on where to go would have been extremely helpful.

I am a fan of the Smackdown games since the beginning of the series,but the games don't change enough for how much they charge. This game has awesome controls,they made the moves easy to do and the moves look realistic.

This game has a great story mode,you start out as Suicide,a masked wrestler who gets jumped by wrestlers who give him a beat down,he is covered in bandages and then you create your own character. The character works himself up from Mexico to a TNA wrestler. The story mode is not serious it's suppose to be chessy. This game took two years to make because they scanned the wrestlers and moves,so this game looks really good,it uses the same the same game engine as Unreal Tournament 3/Gears of War.

The only minor problem I had with it is that not all the puzzles need to be solved to move on to the next chapter.  I hate untidy loose ends; I love to do all the puzzles and want them appropriate to the plot.

In Amerzone, you can overlook a scene that is causing a problem in the plot.  Then, the puzzle that will resolve the problem in that particular scene does not make sense to the gamer because he doesn't see any connection until he blindly solves the puzzle which will then launch a cutscene that shows the reason for the puzzle to begin with.

However, the gameplay videos with semi-open world, crafting, and so many new features eventually drew me in. I pre-ordered the PS3 version on Amazon and quickly played through the game's main story.

I've been a fan of Bioware for a long time, going all the way back to Baldur's Gate on the PC. What I loved about them was their ability to create a world full of interesting and unique characters that I wanted to explore for hours on end, even if I'd already played the game before. The quests were rarely if ever FedEx B.S. and generally added to the story or at least made it more enjoyable (not so in the case of Skyrim or other, similar open-world games for me). With this in mind, it's no wonder that I didn't like Dragon Age 2. With the re-used maps and boring, mostly black-and-white characters, it felt very rushed and half-hearted. Dragon Age Inquisition, on the other hand, went completely beyond my expectations.

The good:
* Interesting characters and lots of them (9 party members and more major characters). They weren't as annoying or preachy as past games' characters (think Wynne).
* Several huge maps and many smaller ones, making it essentially open-world. None of them were re-used.
* Several new features such as crafting, keeps, mounts, and weapon/armor upgrades.
* Skill trees with the good features of both DA2 and DAO.
* Quests and side stories are more than just messenger-style drop quests.
* More quick slots for mapping spells and talents (8, compared to DA2's 3).
* Tactical pause returns for the console version and looks and feels better than in DAO.
* Multiplayer is optional, not forced on you (I'm looking at you, Mass Effect 3).
* Plenty of side quests and additional content in each area.
* Seriously hilarious codex entries and inter-party banter.
* Lots of romance options for people who like that.
* You can choose what armor to equip your party characters with, compared to DA2 when you had to scour the maps looking for upgrades.
* You can make helms and cowls invisible. Thank God; some of them are seriously fugly.
* Dancing and talking animations look smoother and less awkward (especially compared to the weird dancing from Mass Effect).
* You can see past choices reflected in the world, such as Alistair or Anora being royalty, Hawke's appearance and whom she/he supported, and so on.

The bad:
* Utterly horrendous rendering times on the PS3. About 30-45 seconds or more to fully render hair and face textures during cutscenes.
*Occasional freezing or glitching. Freezing happens randomly while running around on the map or going through menus. Glitches include being stuck in the falling animation while talking to someone, being unable to open certain doors at certain points in the game, etc.
* It's easy to get frustrated when navigating larger maps, especially when in mountainous areas where you might have to run half a map down just to get through.
* A certain quest is a pain to get through since the character's dialogue doesn't work quite right. It's a main quest.
* Masterwork crafting with <100% percent chance never actually works. I've confirmed this with two other people who have tried saving and re-loading and re-crafting the item about 30 times.
* Certain side quests are really vague and confusing about where to go or whom to talk to, especially the specialization quests.

Even with the glitches and freezing, I don't think the game is unplayable. Not by a long shot. I've played over 80 hours already on the game and I've had it freeze about three or four times altogether. It does have a tendency to freeze at really irritating times, though, such as after killing a dragon or going through a quest right before returning to Skyhold and autosaving. I suggest saving frequently to avoid losing too much progress. The game would be 5 stars were it not for the freezing and glitching.",Awesome game with a few annoying flaws.,1417392000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,False,"06 5, 2013",A2CH7D7568YXJF,B009AGXH64,Sally,"Let me start off by saying I am a long time Nintendo fan. I started out in the early 90's with an NES, followed by an N64, followed by the Wii, and now the Wii U.

I love Nintendo for allowing backwards compatibility  on the Wii U and for allowing us to transfer our content from the original Wii onto the Wii U. I have to say this though, the instructions made it tough to transfer at first between the two consoles. I ended up having to go to a youtube video just to see how it was done and I finally managed to do it. Just make sure you have an SD card, as well as your original wii remotes ready (preferably 2 wii remotes if you have them. 1 will do the job, but that requires constant syncing and unsyncing between the Wii U and the original Wii console. If you have 2, then you just need 1 remote synced to each console, making it much easier and faster to transfer your content). Keep in mind, once you transfer your content, your original Wii is empty. Everything you did is now on the Wii U.

Now, let's move onto the Gamepad. The gamepad is an interesting way to play. I personally did not think I would like the gamepad that much (I am very picky when it comes to controllers), but I actually do find it to be quite fun to play on. Some games, like Nintendo land, have you use it a lot. Then there are others, such as Super Mario U, that give you the option to use the gamepad or the original Wii Remote. With Nintendo Land, you can do fun things such as tilt the remote to move your character around. Then there are others that allow you to use the gamepad to look around, almost giving you that full 3D effect in a sense. It's definitely different from any other console out there!

Furthermore, the gamepad makes navigation a lot easier in comparison to the original Wii. On the original Wii, typing on the keyboard required you to use the wii remote to point at each letter on the TV screen (this was a pain in the behind because it was such a slow process!!!). Now, on the Wii U, the keyboard is on your gamepad, allowing you to select each letter the same way you would on a tablet. This makes navigation so much quicker and a lot less frustrating!

The TVii is a good tool to have as well. I have not played around with it too much yet (I rarely watch TV these days anymore), but I have checked it out. I do enjoy the TV guide they provide for you on the Gamepad, allowing you to scroll through it and select a particular show you want to watch. If you already have a TV guide on your TV to begin with though, then you probably won't be as amazed by this feature because you already have it. Personally, for me, I love it because we are old school in my house. We just have regular cable with no guide, so having it on the Wii U gamepad is really useful for me.

Also, similar to the original Wii, you still have Netflix, Hulu Plus, Youtube, etc. Again, these things are FAR more easier to navigate thanks to the keyboard on the gamepad now.

One thing that disappoints me so far is the lack of games. I currently play two games: Nintendo Land and Super Mario U. No other games really interest me at this moment, but I do hear they are in the process of making them later on in the year, which is good news. You can either be an early bird like me and get this console now, so that way you are all set and prepared for the new releases in the fall. Or you can hold off and just wait until the titles are available before buying the console. I personally like to be prepared ahead of time, so that way I'm not forking up all my money at once, but that is just me.

Lastly, I want to talk about MiiVerse. This was another feature that I did not think I would use much, but I actually find myself posting quite a bit on there. MiiVerse is a way for you to connect with anyone worldwide. You can share comments, start discussions, give each other tips on how to beat a level, etc. You can even draw and post your drawings. I have hand written messages on there, as well as typed messages, and some drawings. The pen that comes with the gamepad makes drawing very easy and fun. You can draw just as good as if you were using a pen on paper. It is that accurate!

Overall, the Wii U is a great console! As I said, it just needs more games, but the games will come as time passes. What we have now are just the launch titles. So again, either hold off and wait for the games to come, or get yourself the Wii U console now and just play your original Wii games on it until more Wii U games come out.","Love it, but it needs more games",1370390400,4,,

4.0,True,"01 1, 2006",ABIVKBMSIPEDY,B0002XJBGE,Kiyo M.,"Before purchasing this controller, I have been using the Logitech Wingman RumblePad and Thrustmaster Firestorm Dual Power controllers. And finally, I decided to go wireless. However, not only did the wireless and the brand ""Logitech"" interest me, but it was the familiar interface to Sony's PlayStation controller.

It basically IS a PS controller, but with some minor tweaks. The 8-directional D-Pad feels much better (kind of reminds me of the original NES D-pad). The D-pad on my other two controllers (the WingMan and FireStorm) feel extremely stiff compared to this Rumblepad 2; definitely would work well with fighting games. The 4 buttons on the right are easy to press and big. The added weight of the two AA batteries actually makes the controller feel better: not ""cheap"" and more solid.

I appreciate the numbers (not some random letters or shapes) written on all the buttons for assigning the controls. (When you assign buttons with the controller for a specific game, it correctly displays as ""Button 1"" and ""Button 2"" and so forth. My Wingman controller had letters for each button, which helped in no way; it made things confusing.)

The wireless response is excellent. I can practically go anywhere in my house and hear the game still respond to my controls! I have enough cords around my computer, so this made it convenient: easy to store and take out only when I need to play. I have routers and other electronics around, but I have not encountered any conflict.

I do have ONE complaint, however (this might be the same as the PS controller): personally, I think the handles are too short, so it makes holding the left joystick a bit awkward; I have to raise a part of my palm to use the left joystick. It may be okay for children's hands, but a bit uncomfortable for an adult-sized hand. On the other hand (sorry for the pun), I can hold the handles securly and comfortably when using the D-pad.

Pros:
* Wireless; excellent response.
* 12 programmable buttons (including the joystick *BUTTONS*; press down on the joystick)
* D-Pad is soft and easy to press
* Solid feel
* Vibration feedback
* Buttons with its corresponding number written
* Grip on joystick
* Black design and simple
* Plug & Play

Cons:
* Short handles: makes holding the left joystick feel a bit awkward.

Overall, I would still recommend this controller. I already owned two controllers before this, but this was worth the upgrade.

There are different modes you get to play and different missions for you to do.  The whole game is basically rioting and looting in order to take down the corporation.  You get to pick up objects and throw them through store windows.  (Didn't get that in ""GTA 3,"" now did ya?)  While roaming through packs of maniac looters in outrageous crowds, it is your job to create as much mayhem as possible.  You can either do missions or create mayhem on your own.
The coolest part of this game is that you can use body parts as weapons.  That's right; find a leg, arm, or a head on the floor, pick it up and bash people to death with them.  As disgusting as that sounds, it's actually quite humorous and entertaining.  A little cartoonish in a way, but still very cool.

4.0,False,"08 27, 2011",A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET,B005DKZSVS,Robert,"Setting this unit up was very frustrating.

1.)  I was shocked that there were separate USB cables for each of the lights that had to be plugged into my computer.  1 for each!  I don't have that many USB ports on my laptop when I include all the other things that are plugged into it, in fact I had to unplug something, and now bought a USB hub.

2.) In addition, you have to plug each unit into the wall.  Granted it's one adapter with two lines on it, but that's 4 wires (2 from the USB lines) and a lot of tangling going on for just two lights.

3.) Even though both units were plugged into the wall; upon plugging them into my computer (a very powerful laptop which was plugged into the wall as well) the computer shut down accesss to the USB drive b/c of a power surge these units caused.  Not a good sign, this is the first time in my life something like this has happened.

4.) After inserting the installation CD the program didn't install correctly; had to re-do it for whatever reason.

5.) The troubleshooting instructions for when the lights fail to work are bogus.  They did not work.

SOLUTION:  It's simple, but so many programs/devices nowadays don't need to have it done that I've forgotten about it: restart the darn computer and everything (lights) turned on.

Afterwards,  things went much smoother.  The program automatically detects what is installed on your computer that can produce lighting effects.  Some programs, like Call of Duty 2 weren't detected, but when launched, the lights continued to function.

These lights, while small, are very bright!  I wouldn't recommend looking directly at them (even when you adjust them to low intensity) and they should be set so that they are essentially reflecting off of a wall, otherwise you see the 3 separate light bulbs giving off 3 lights, when in essence and actuality they merge at a focal point a foot or two away to produce a single color.

When listening to music I have to admit the colors they produced to match the music was almost natural.  I was very impressed.

When playing COD2, well, they didn't do too much.  Basically the reflected a red light to indicate where the bullet was coming from.  And frankly the fact that the game itself gives you that warning, and I'm so focused on the game, the lights are really almost not there at all.

Overall, these are really nice substitutes to set a mood (e.g. to replace candles) when listening to music.  Or maybe to add a more colorful experience to a movie, and it may work better for some other genre of games.

In general, the fact that gaming, music, and video is now moving into a 4D environment (i.e. special seats, fans, lights, etc..) with lots of open source applications is a very nice trend to see.  I guess in about 5-10 years one can build a pretty nice 4D experience right at home.

I give this unit 4 stars.  It's really nice, well built, and well designed.  But the fact that there are so many wires is very frustrating.",Nice product,1314403200,,,
4.0,False,"09 11, 2004",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0006GBD04,Tsanche,"Alright, my Pokemaniac days are over but every now and then I'll pick a game up.  Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen are a revamped up version of Pokemon Red and Blue.  Just five to six years ago Pokemon was THE game to get!  I remember going to school with my gameboy to trade with other ""trainers"" all the time.  This was THE game to own back then.  Of course it isn't so much the same for me now but it is nice when a classic is revived.  Unfortunately for Nintendo, its a shame that they work on a lot of the negative things about the previous games.

To begin, this game is no surprise to the Pokemon fan.  The story has been the same since its release in 1999.  You're a trainer striving to be the best trainer he or she can be.  You go around the world collecting badges from the gyms all over to prove that you're a pokemon master.  As the formula goes, you've got a rival and you fight other trainers throughout the game as well.

The gameplay has since its relase in '99 remained unchanged.  It borrows elements from Ruby and Sapphire, the two on two battles but much like Ruby and Sapphire you don't get to enjoy those kind of battles too often. You run around the field getting into random encounters.  You send a pokemon that you caught in the wild out to battle. You can carry up to six in your inventory at a time.  On the field you can also find trainers to do battle with.

Perhaps what strikes me most about the game is that in battle looks a lot sharper and nicer than in the previous versions.  Battle also paces a lot faster than before and the animations look a lot better as well.

The graphics have been updated to suit the GBA and they're absolutely gorgeous!  They're smooth and look astonishing.  The graphics are crisp and the game doesn't suffer too much from the pixel problem the GBA has.  Very smooth and colorful as well. The only downside to the graphics is once again, in battle the graphics do not live up to the full potential of the GBA. They STILL only twitch to attack and never actually touch their enemy.  In battle also still lacks color and scenery.

The sound, I wish I could say is good.  But since the sound has only been updated to sound sixteen bit, that means its still a little annoying. The sound in the first release wasn't anything to jump around about and this re-release is no different.  Some tunes actually sound a bit more annoying than before.

What has been unique about the Pokemon games is how after you've completed it there's more to do. Once you've completed the game you can catch more pokemon and challenge previous trainers to duel only their pokemon are at higher levels.  You'll more than likely spend more time going through the aftermath of the game than the actual storyline itself.

Every Pokemon fan knows that the only way to completely master Pokemon is to catch 'em all.  That's the reason for releasing two different versions.  The only difference between the FireRed and LeafGreen games is simply the different pokemon you catch.  Some pokemon are no availible in one version and therefore you must trade with the other version.

Perhaps the only BIG con is simply if you've got that brutally mastered file on the original GB version one and spent 200 hours doing it all to get everything you possibly could, you probably won't be too happy to do it all over again on virtually the same game and since you can't bring in your pokemon from the original Red and Blue, some may not be too pleased to have to raise all their pokemon all over again.

These are near perfect games because you get exactly what you're expecting, and then some. As the title suggests, Cooking Mama 2 is a cooking game with 80 recipes from around the world, including favorites like kimchee and pancakes. You prepare food in steps, with Mama giving you helpful hints and scores along the way. The over-the-top cutesy graphics and intuitive gameplay make this a favorite with kids, but there's finesse involved that even adults will find frustrating. These games are perfect for the Achiever in your life, and Cooking Mama 2 pushes the idea further, adding unlockable customizations to your kitchen and Mama's wardrobe.

The most impressive feature of the Cooking Mama titles are their utilization of Nintendo hardware. Cooking Mama 2 continues to caress the DS with innovative stylus play. Move your stylus around a meat grinder's handle to make it go. Crack an egg by drawing a line to the bowl - slowly, or you'll wind up with egg on your hand. Blow into the microphone to ensure a pot of boiling water won't boil over. There are several dozen different mechanics available, and most of them are easy to grasp, but difficult to master. Most of the preparation requires that you beat the clock, but if you chop without stopping, or pull a piece of meat out of the frier at just the right moment, you can receive bonuses. This makes basic gameplay a snap, and advanced gameplay an ART.

After you've unlocked some recipes, you can cook for Mama's friends. Mama won't give you hints on what you should do, but since you've worked through the recipe at least once, you won't need hints. As a result, preparing food for Mama's friends is a much speedier process, and the rewards or penalties are greater. If you mess up when you're cooking for Mama's friends, Mama's not there to help you and your preparation is cut short before you can finish. If you do well, you receive presents and can unlock special items for customizing your game.

You can customize Mama's dress, accessories, the appearance of her kitchen, and the color of all the kitchen utensils you use in the game. There are 10 dress types (with several color options each), 5 accessories, and 5 kitchen settings to unlock. I like customizing everything to match to an unnatural degree, but many players will love dressing up Mama in wacky lemon earrings and strange cheerleader outfits. Not every friend you impress will unlock an item - sometimes the presents are just nice things to look at that don't stay in your game, like a kitten or a treasure chest.

As with previous releases, you can practice any part of a recipe, and set records for yourself in specific preparation techniques. Both Cooking Mama 1 and 2 for the DS offer wireless play, so you can challenge your friends to an egg-cracking contest. This isn't as cool as Cooking Mama Cookoff for the Wii, where you can execute an entire recipe against friends, but there's still something very appealing about proclaiming yourself the Queen of the Deep Fryer and laying the smackdown in an egg-cracking competition.

There are a few annoying parts of the game. Bonuses are now meaningful - each one you get earns you one star out of 5, and for every 5 stars, you get a present. But the presents aren't unlocked items, they're just cute graphic rewards. Calculating these bonuses takes a lot of time, and the accompanying music is very loud. It's nice that the bonuses have some kind of reward, but I'd prefer points or records to an overkill of praise. Some of the mechanics are still a little too hard to master. I find stewing and simmering to be a pain, because you have to wait for the food the food to cook until it's reached the green part of the progress meter, but you also have to control temperature and stir - not too often - to make sure the food doesn't pass the green sweet spot on the meter and remains exactly there until time is up. Adjusting the temperature of the stove and stirring will wildly change the food's progress meter, so it's very difficult to do with respect to the timer.

This is not my favorite Cooking Mama title, but the improvements significantly enhance the replay value and enjoyability of the game. Within a release or two, this game will be perfect, deadly addictive, and completely free of design flaws.

-Motion controls- going over a log will undoubtedly trigger you tilt your vita to regain balance. Needless and irritating.
-Touch screen controls- this is fine for assembling torn papers in the game but when they put it in combat or when a platform breaks it really takes you out of the gameplay.
You can also use the touch screen to do all of the platforming for you, if for some reason you just felt like skipping the main appeal of the game, however this thankfully they let you do with buttons.
You need to mimic arrow motions in the middle of combat, so you'll have to counter a guy by swiping up or something on the screen.
-Camera use- you need to use the camera to see a message through a piece of paper, this would be fine if the room I was in had a light the game thought was bright enough, I put the system right over a bulb and it didn't go any higher, I had to wait to use my desk lamp for this to work.
*Note that with the exception of touch platforming, none of these are optional, you need to use them to progress in the game.

Overall: Despite the gripes, it does do everything you'd expect of Uncharted as a series, it's a really solid game if you can ignore the stupid motion/touch controls forced into the game. It's no means a slouch of the series, if you liked the others it's worth it to get this because it's basically identical but portable. It's top notch and there's no game like this on any handheld device currently, it's damn pretty, sounds great, does what the series is known for and it won't disappoint.

Note: You'll probably want to buy this game as a physical copy because it's massive, it's about 3.2gb.",The weakest in the Uncharted series but still awesome.,1360540800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,True,"08 6, 2010",A1A89LQ8C1AYV1,B000ZKA0J6,Christopher Deweese,"Startcraft 2, the most anticipated game of the decade.  That's a bold statement, but it's a deserved one given the shear scope and overall quality of this game.  Blizzard outdid themselves with this one, in more ways than one.  They upped the visuals.  They upped the story.  They also limited your multiplayer options (in more ways than one).  To be clear, I'm not a big MP guy in the first place, so I'm not going to shed too many tears.  But there were so many options in the original Starcraft that this new incarnation feels a bit gimped.

I love single player campaigns.  This is where SC2 outdoes its predecessor.  The missions themselves don't really do a lot to drive the story, but the cutscenes are very well done.  The exposition does a lot to flesh out the story.  Voice acting is great.  The graphics look very good, but I wouldn't say they are jaw dropping.  The level of control is just what you'd expect from an RTS.  I love the units, the upgrades, pretty much everything.

The main flaws with this game affect multiplayer.  There is no more LAN support (not that I ever participated in any LAN parties).  Also, it's region locked, so you can't play against your buddies across the pond.  It's also possible that Blizzard could block you from playing the game if your ISP changes your IP address after installing the game (how often does that really happen?  But it's still a potentially fatal flaw for this game if it's true).  Why Blizzard chose to implement these changes and limitations I'll never know (perhaps Activision swayed them, ya think?).  Regardless of these flaws, getting into MP matches is easy.  The match making system works pretty well, but if you're a noob be prepared to get annihilated a lot in the beginning.

Starcraft 2 was worth the wait.  It really is a fun game with an interesting story.  It's beautiful to look at and easy to learn.  Like everyone else, I'm eager to get my hands on the next two installments (whenever that will be).  If you're big into MP you might steer clear of this game and stick with the original Starcraft.",Not a Lot of Liberty With These Wings,1281052800,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

HOMM 4 had a totally different feel from the third installment.  Some of these new aspects are good while others make you wish they'd kept things the same as before.  Having your heroes fight in combat is really cool, and even if they die you can get them back in various ways.  Also, the new skills and class system adds a ton of depth to the game as you now get to chose what your hero becomes.  Most of the new creatures are pretty cool (although since when is the ballista considered a ""creature"").  The game does seem to play a little slower than HOMM3 although you can vary the speed at which you and opposing heroes move both on the world map and in combat.  I also love the addition of a caravan.  No more having to have one hero be the transporter of troops back and forth.  Also, the creatures in the towns grow at a more realistic rate, meaning new ones appear each day.  Growth is still based on weekly totals though so if you buy all the creatures for that week no more will appear till the next week.
  Lots of good stuff but there are some bad aspects.  The graphics, while 3D and more realistic, seem to have lost something.  I can't exactly say what but I prefered the more fantasy looking creatures of HOMM 3.  The new magic and class system can be confusing at first even to veterans of HOMM.  Castle seiges have also been taken down a notch in HOMM4.  There are no arrow towers, catapults, etc in seige battles.  There are still walls, the drawbridge, and a moat and the defenders' ranged troops occupy perches inside the castle to give them an advantage but to me seige battles have lost something in this edition.  Also, during combat it can sometimes be hard to tell who you're attacking.  I know I've meant to attack one creature stack and ended up just flying next to them or hitting a completely different set of enemies.  There is no multiplayer yet (it says it will be added for FREE, however) but this really doesn't effect me since I prefer to play alone or just have hotseat games w/ my friends.  All in all, HOMM4 is a welcome, albeit somewhat flawed, edition to the Heroes series.

4.0,True,"01 9, 2016",A92C5VO4UDJZP,B00GB0OS7Y,Keroberus,"This is really bishounen eye candy or reverse-harems but we like what we like.  This is a really pretty box set and the curios are adorable (not usable but cute for collecting).  Some of the curios become more relevant when you've played the side quests.

I played Hijikata's main route first because he has been a favorite samurai idol (Kaze no Hikaru, Hakuoki anime series) for a while.  The graphics, the voice acting, the artistry and the detailed history lesson were worth the purchase for die hard Hakuoki fans.  I bought it with a gift card and not my own money so maybe if I spent money on it, I'd be less satisfied.  It can get repetitive fast especially if you're aiming to get all the CG's for all the characters. (Trophies FTW!)

The mature rating predominantly goes to cursing.  Otherwise not really sure why it's M rating. There is no sex, cartoon violence, some blood and guts, political themes and did I mention NO SEX?  The romance is pretty mild, and for an M rating, that's a little odd (i.e. disappointing).

Fans will be familiar with the story of the Shinsengumi, but I totally teared up during Kondo's sacrifice and during the expected deaths of some characters. Though the story sticks to history pretty closely, and there is a lot of Japanese History exposition in this game, the fact that some lead characters die in several plot lines when historically they did not was a little incredulous. But then again, we're dealing with supernatural demons and vampiric zombies in this game, and people who actually die in history end up coming out alive, so maybe I shouldn't have been surprised that the game kills off people who historically aren't supposed to die.

I found Hijikata's path the longest and most fulfilling because you see the Shinsengumi's story from its inglorious beginning to its bitter end.  Saito, Heisuke, Okita, Kazama, all detract from the Shinsengumi's fate so that was fun to experience the slight change in plot/villains.

But I suppose the most disappointing of all was the heroine herself.  She's absolutely dull as rocks in Hijikata's plot line, but her personality improves with all the other characters.

You can't ""unlock"" the bonus material without some effort but it will be worth it if you're a fan.  Not only does this game combine the main Hakuoki game-play, it also includes Hakuoki: Stories of the Shinsengumi, and each character's ""Memories of Love"" (little side quests that parallel the main story line for the protagonist with every character).  The bonus material unlocks (if you select the right choices to bloom the Ephemera sakura tree) only when you complete the characters' side quests (Stories & Memories of Love).  Completing all the main stories will get you the CG's and earn you trophies, but will not unlock the bonus material.  The catch is that you have to finish at least two main storylines to unlock the side quests.

If you want to ""finish"" the game and earn those trophies you have to play routes you're really not that interested in.... and that's a lot of fast forwarding...  But they have an alternate FF function that stops during text/plots you haven't experienced before so that's helpful for not missing out on new plot lines/dialogue.

The bonus material is delightful.  It throws all the characters into a modern setting, as if they reincarnated and are back together again.  It is also the basis for the Hakuoki SSL (Sweet School Life) TV drama, and the PS Vita game.

Let me give you a feel for this game. If you played the previous title, let me note that this game is in no way related to it in any way, shape or form. The developers took what was great in that game and completely remastered the whole experience for the player. So, what sort of adventure do Finn and Jake find themselves this time around?
As usual, Princess Bubblegum sends our heroes to a mysterious unexplored region in the Land of Ooo. If you haven't guessed, its the Nameless Kingdom. Our duo finds themselves in a land filled with dangerous creatures and scattered with many ancient dungeons waiting to be explored. Their objective is simple: travel to three ancient temples and rescue the three princesses (Lullaby, Nightmare and Slumber) that have mysteriously disappeared.
Sounds simple enough, correct? Of course not! Otherwise it wouldnt be fun for our heroes or the players, now would it? As you travel toward any of these ancient temples, you cannot resist the urge but to take notice that the game plays a lot like classic top-down Zelda titles. From the sword swinging action to the pot breaking mayhem, this game has it all. Every temple has unique challenges that require the player to think critically on how to escape or advance. I favor games that really challenge me to use the old noodle. A rare sight these days. This isn't your typical get from point A to point B. There are challenges you must overcome in nearly every corner.
Compared to the other Adventure Time titles, you feel, see, and hear the differences. The original voice acting is what really drew me into this game. Theres nothing like playing a game and having your favorite characters actually interact with you.
In regards to gameplay, youll find yourself as protagonist Finn with Jake securely in his shirt pocket. This humorously enough can be used as your shield. You start with three hearts and as you complete temples you find heart pieces that increase your health (now can you see the Zelda influence?). Swing your grass sword as you attempt to complete many challenges to unlock specific doors that hide much loot and treasure. As you progress through the game youll unlock special powers that can be used to solve future puzzles or defeat enemies with hidden weaknesses.
The enemies introduced to the game, are many found in The Land of Ooo. Youll definitely feel oddly familiar with certain characters if you're a fan of the animated show. Examples being magic pigs or mesmerizing caterpillars and the ever so familiar skeletons. As a special treat for fans of the popular television show on Cartoon Network, you just may find characters from your favorite episodes. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I suggest you look everywhere both high and low. Part of the challenge these temples provide is your skills with memorization and problem solving which were skills I lacked when starting out, but eventually came up with clever solutions to. My advice to any of you picking up this game, take full advantage of your 3DS game notes functionality (can be found on the home menu located to the left of your friends list). This feature has became my trusty navigation guide which assisted me in breezing through several puzzles. Also, be sure to practice up on your retracing skills, itll serve vital to your success at completing puzzles.
Kudos to the sound team behind this game. Everything from Finns footsteps to enemies scrambling to deplete every last one of your hearts has a clean and crisp sound to it. The music matches the various environments, and the ambiance used in each mystical place you explore is top-notch.
All in all, this Legend of Zelda inspired title now has a special place in my heart for the sheer feel of it and amazing puzzles waiting to be solved and experienced. Will you join Finn and Jake as they explore this new land to discover the Secrets of the Nameless Kingdom? Id highly recommend it as this game gets a solid 4/5",Your Adventure Awaits!,1422576000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

My Quickfire Rapid-i I received back from them has a more uniform feeling between all of the keys/switches (an issue I had with the original qfr I got), plus the backlighting (with the upgraded firmware) is a really neat feature as well.

It is easier to swap out keycaps with other custom keycaps with this model, since it has Cherry Stabilizers. My only two complaints are that the usb port is more exposed compared to the non backlit Quickfire Rapid, meaning it could be more susceptible to being broken if you pulled on the wire too hard, and that the keycaps it comes start to shine from being used fairly quickly, as they are ABS (if I'm wrong please correct me).

4.0,True,"04 1, 2010",A2SJ7L8QB52WDW,B0017ZIIK6,jgcrackerass,"First off, I will go ahead and allow everyone to categorize me before reading my review. I was a kid when the first Mortal Kombat came out on Genesis and thought it was awesome. I really liked the second one as well, the third one pissed me off, and the 4th one for N64 was pretty much impossible to play. I haven't played Mortal Kombat since the one for N64 came out, which was probably about 15 years ago if my memory serves me right. I liked Street Fighter 2 when it came out, and couldn't stand any iteration of it since. Tekken to me was retarded because all of my friends played it like it was some kind of drug, and I could pick up a controller and mash buttons on it and win and they would just get mad as hell at me. To me, that kind of game is pointless. I haven't bought a fighting game since I got the Wu tang clan game for Playstation which was hilarious if not frustrating to no end. I was skeptical about buying a fighting game I hadn't played yet, as it seems every one that comes out is boring or stupid or just not fun at all. I got this game on Amazon for like 20 bucks and after reading the reviews on here it sounded like something I would like. It is. This is probably the most fun fighting game I have ever played. It perfectly (to me) combines what I loved about the old mortal kombat and SF games with the new (again, to me) style of figting games that I don't much care for, but have to respect their controls and graphics. This game has it all. It has the flashy, cool looking special moves that Mortal Kombat was famous for, and it eliminates the majority of the frustrating parts (i.e. the infinite sweep, etc.) It's controls are very good, and I never feel like it's just not doing what I want it to do. The moves are not overcomplicated, so someone like me who can't sit in their mothers basement for 25 hours a day playing constantly to master every player can actually perform moves and combo's that look cool and are effective. Having said that, my wife can sit down to play with me (heh heh heh) and she can figure out a couple moves and use those in combination with mashing the buttons and still hold her own against me. I win more than lose, but she can still get me with about 10 hits in a row before I can figure out what to do to break away. We both have a lot of fun playing this game, and really enjoy the graphics and controls. It's violent enough to not make you feel like you're playing tekken and the fatalies are cool even though they're toned down. I would sacrifice some violence to get to beat up superman with barakka. The story was cheesy, but good for a fighting game, and entertaining at the least. One more thing to note is, if you get whipped by the computer in story mode, it will progressively get easier to beat until you win, and which point it will start getting harder again until you lose, etc. I found this seemingly small detail totally eliminated all of the frustration I usually feel when playing against the computer in a fighting game. I would recommend this to anyone who is a casual gamer that wants a solid fighting game in thier collection that will not only keep their interest, but look really cool and be a lot of fun to play.

Lots of penalties just like NHL 10 (love those 5 on 3 2 man advantages)
Goal Reviews (love it)
Broken sticks (nice idea until it happens to you)

Cons:
The graphics look like they took a slight step backward in the player models. Also the opening scene where the teams are announced is kind of cheesy looking (liked 09 and 10 much better)

the basic premise of the story is that you have heaven and hell, then there's a council which is a third party mediary to keep balance. the four horsemen work for the council. you play as War, summoned to earth on the day of the apocalypse only to find the seventh seal hasn't been broken and he shouldn't be there. as punishment the council strips him of his power and war is sent back to earth to clear his name. demons, angels, and nasty little beasties are all trying to kill you.

this game has it's fair share of negative features, you get two weapons and you can change it up but i've never liked one button fighting systems, they just don't allow for the depth of a real combat system. and the amount of gear you get is a bit much. about halfway through the game you get a gun but it quickly gets shelved in the back of your inventory in favor of items that have a utility function like the boomerang or a portal generating gauntlet. the portal gauntlet is kinda disapointing, seems like everyone is trying to cash in on the popularity of portal these days, however in aplication in the game it works ok as a puzzle solver. but there's more, and alot of them are used in tandem so there's plenty of shuffling with your palette in the heat of the moment.

the character design leaves something to be desired, war has this weird hodgepodge of armor and his proportions are just rediculous, it reminds me of the way they do world of warcraft characters or kids shows. it's a kind of lazy frame to me, the whole big hands and feet thing just grates on me. but other than that the enemies and suporting characters don't look so bad, ulthane is kinda cool but a simple design.

but my biggest gripe by far is the fast travel system. whenever you want to get quickly from one side of the map to the other you travel from one merchant location to another. but that entales walking a little walkway in some etherial plane. there's nothing going on in there you just walk from one end of a room to the other. there's some stairs and occasionally there are breaks in the walkway you have to jump over. so there is no reason for it at all. i'd almost prefer a loading screen to something this useless.

my final complaint is the response time. this game often times doesn't recognize multiple quick inputs on the controller and often times you'll get dinged here and there because your expecting something to come imediatly following what you just did. it gets frustrating at times.

but overall it's a really fun experience and i find myself eagerly waiting for the sequel. i'd recomend buying this game to almost anyone who's big into games in general",cluttered but a great game,1265500800,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

4.0,True,"03 1, 2012",A3LITTAG6VXDOM,B005N4HC2M,Phillip T. Rutherford,"So, to start this review I would like to state that I approached this controller like I do everything that is third party. With skepticism.

I've been eyeballing these online for months, as the sales pitch for them is intriguing, and the implementation of the changes from a standard controller make a certain amount of sense to me. However, I've read them, and I'm sure everyone reading this has probably read the reports, and reviews, making mention of a few problems associated with the controller. The number one concern, and complain, is quality. A lot of people, especially the early adopters of this product, have had some severe problems with the product breaking or otherwise not functioning properly after a few days of use. That was the number one hangup for me even making the commitment to give this product a try.

The only reason why I finally caved in and tried it was finding mention on a few forums that Razer, the manufacturer, had implemented some quality assurance changes to the design to make them more durable. I couldn't really find any hard evidence of this, but most of the complaints about this came from very earlier reviews, so I decided to give it a try.

Overall, I've got to admit I'm impressed with the controller. As I stated above, I as very skeptical of features of this controller from the moment I heard about them. But, I find the crisp audio feedback of the ""click"" from each button to be very helpful in knowing that I did indeed click it, and the game should register the input, unlike a stock controller, where sometimes I bash a button four or five times and it doesn't register. Also, I can tell a definite difference in the responsiveness of the mechanical buttons over the mashed potato feel of the factory controller face buttons. This applies to all buttons on the controller, and the sticks ""clicking"", with the exception of the D-pad. The back lit buttons are also a nice touch, but I play in a well light room anyway so I don't notice them too much. The triggers feel tight, and hyper responsive like the rest of the buttons, which takes some adjustment to get used to. Not sure how this controller would work for a racing game.

Now, this D-pad is steps above of the factory D-pad, even the ""new design"" available on certain Xbox controllers. However, I don't know if it will help fans of fighting games out every much. I don't play them much so I can't speak to the pro's or cons for that genre of game. As far as items mapped to a D-pad in any given game, there is real feel of better accuracy to pushing these, both in how they feel and in how your game responds. I feel much more confident that I'll come up with the item I need in a pinch with this controller than I do with my standard controller.

The sticks, and adjustable tension, is pretty nice. This aspect of the controller is what most intrigued me about it, and what kept me from being able to dismiss it like I have every other third party controller. Well that and Razers reputation on PC gaming accessories. The tension adjustment is quite noticeable, and actually feels pretty good. I was afraid it would just make the stick range of motion feel restricted, but that is not quite what its like. Its just what is says it is, more tension on either stick, as high or as low as you want. I seem to recall reading that the sticks on this controller were slightly taller, but if they are it then it wasn't all enough for me. After 30 to 40 seconds of using them as they were, I was already pulling out the FPS Freak extensions that I've used for years. If you're a fan of them and want this controller, rest assured they fit just fine. Also, the top of the Razer sticks are pretty smooth, so the textures of the FPS freak extensions was welcome. The sticks click just fine most of the time, though I have noticed every once in a while the left one gets stuck when I attempt to press it while holding the stick at an angle. Hasn't been an issue for me thus far, just something I've noticed from time to time.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FPS-Freek-by-KontrolFreek-Ultra/dp/B004VLYIE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FPS Freek by KontrolFreek (Ultra)</a>

As far as responsiveness goes, it took me a few matches of Battle Field 3 to get adjusted to this controller. The sticks seem more responsive than a standard controller,even with the tension on high, or maybe my controller was just getting old but I don't think this was an issue. Once I adjusted, it felt pretty good. The next day when I first started playing, I again had an ""adjustment"" period to get reflexes I've developed on a standard controller for years adjusted to this new controller. That took about a match or so. Now, after a month of play, I still find myself having a small adjustment period each day, but it keeps getting shorter and shorter with more use of this controller.

The two multifunction buttons on the shoulders are a nice addition, and work well. They are the second reason I was interested in this controller. Being able to map functions to these two buttons reduces the need to remove your thumb from the control sticks in most games, and its a nice touch. However, their placement along with the other 2 shoulder buttons can lead to some confusion at first. Also, I'm not sure if they just stick out further or if they two standard buttons are just lower to make room for the two new ones, but I do find myself clipping the right side shoulder button by accident from time to time when I depress the right side trigger. I've had to adjust my grip on the right side of the controller to avoid this, but old habits die hard and I still do it at least once a night, resulting in me swiping a knife at someone instead of shooting them in Battle Field 3.

Oh, and the braided cord is nice to look at it, but I find it kind of annoying. While it less prone to kinking up, it seems harder to remove kinks or knots whenever it does get tangled up with another cord, or just develops a kink. Trade off I guess.

Other than the one stick getting stuck every once in a while, I've only noticed on other small issue with this controller. I pick up a slight hiss of static in my Astro A40 headsets whenever I have them plugged into this controller. Thankfully I had heard this mentioned in another review, or I might have driven myself crazy trying to eliminate it from my audio connectors, since I'd just got my A40's back from warranty services for a audio problem anyway. Sitting in a party just talking with friends, it is somewhat noticeable. When playing a game with all of the noises associated with a game going on, I'm never even aware of it no matter how many people are talking.

Oh, and the rubber material of the controller feels better in the hand than the hard plastic finish of others. I've never had a sweaty hand problem, so I don't know if it does anything to reduce that, but it feels good!

So I've had it a month, and those are the only two negative issues with it. *crosses fingers* Oh and removing it from the packaging was moderately annoying. I had to un-spool the cord to feed it out of the packaging materials.

Other than that, I'm happy with this product. Its hard to quantify if has actually ""improved my game"" any, and beyond just saying it feels better to me once I became comfortable with it, I only have a small amount of data judge with. Yes, there was a lot of confusion, and miss fires with the extra buttons while adjusting to it, plus my above mentioned awkwardness with the new control sticks. Once I rewired my reflexes to the new controller, it feels great, and it plays great.

To add to that, I have my statistics from the Battle Field battlelog service to use a metric for this new controller. Since this game came out in October of 2011, my ""overall"" accuracy rating held a constant 13 percent accuracy. It had raised slightly in January to a %13.2 rating.

 In the month I've had this controller, my accuracy has raised from that to 14.9 percent overall accuracy rating. Now part of that might be attributed to being a veteran player and becoming more accustomed to the firing mechanics of the game. Also, I started using some new weapons that I'd previously had no rating for. New data from those weapons probably served to bump my rating slightly, and I think that was more likely the cause of my slight bump up before getting this controller. I also watched the individual accuracy rating for a few of my favorite guns, and noticed a slight bump in accuracy across each of those weapons after getting accustomed to this controller.

So, its not exactly scientific data that I'm using for measurement there, or even a real scientific method for that matter. Just my own observations, but it does feel better, and the control sticks do feel more accurate. I'm not going to claim my kill death ratio skyrocketed with this controller or any of that bullcrap you see in ""endorsements"" for a product. I am saying that I feel it is a  better controller, but its not going to make you a better player, or change how you play a game. If you get killed a lot right now, that's probably on you. But I do feel this controller can give you a slight edge in reaction times thanks to the hyper responsive buttons, and more accurate control stick inputs over people not using it. Also it is a wired control, so its going to have a faster response time that a wireless controller will anyway as there is no lag time.

Small note. The Xbox live chat pad will not work with this controller, and certain headsets might not work as well. I own a Triton ""Detonator"" headset that I used for a backup set while my Astro gaming headset had been sent off for repairs. The Triton set has a small ""clamp"" like connector to plug into the microphone jack, similar to what you see on a standard Xbox live headset. That will not match up to this controller, and will not connect. So if you're a lone wolf, this isn't going to be an issue for you. Or if you're the type of gamer looking at a controller like this anyway. you've probably got a custom headset of some kind anyway. A stand 3.5mm jack will fit fin as long as it doesn't have the type of clamp mentioned above. Check it out and plan accordingly before buying this. I actually had to wait two days to use it because of this issue.

Final words...

I'm happy with the controller. So happy I've actually ordered a second one to use as a backup. Why do I want a backup? Well, there were a lot of reports about the low quality build of this controller, and just to test myself I unplugged it a couple of nights ago to try out a regular controller again. After an hour I was still having issues going back. I feel like there probably isn't any going back for me. So just in case this one breaks and I have to file for the warranty on it, I want to have a second one to use in the mean time. Also, it didn't help that Razer announced the Mass Effect 3 edition two days after I purchased the the Battle field 3 version.  I could have just sent it back, but after debating on this controller for 4 or 5 months, I didn't want to back off for another month after committing to the decision.

Hope this helps anyone else out there who is on the fence like I was. If it lasts, it'll be a great controller. If it breaks, it'll still be a good controller in my mind.",Its actually pretty nice,1330560000,2,{'Edition:': ' Tournament - Battlefield 3'},

4.0,False,"10 15, 2005",A2TUCS8O6AJXKJ,B0009VQANQ,--,"Darkwatch is, technically, one of the slickest and most responsive shooters to grace the console systems. On the other hand, it's oft-delayed development cycle did nothing to prevent the finished product from coming across half-baked in most every other department.

Interestingly, the game is set in the old West, but with a gothic twist. It seems our protagonist, the outlaw Jericho Cross, has just robbed the wrong train - instead of sacks of wealth it contains an evil vampire lord. Unwittingly unleashing said vampire from the custody of the shadowy organization known as the Darkwatch, this creature of the night proceeds to raise the dead and wreak all kinds of havoc. Sound cool? Yeah, it certainly does, but the implementation of this unique setting leaves much to be desired, and the ensuing plot makes little sense.

This is exceedingly unfortunate, as the gameplay here is well worth any shooter's raised eyebrow. The production values are spot on, and the action has been polished to a blue steel sheen. Think Painkiller meets Halo and you may have some idea what to expect with this one. Blasting countless vampires and other beasties into oblivion with heavily modified old Western firepower is the highlight... and all that blasting is certainly cathartic fun. A cool arsenal and a handful of vampyric superpowers provide action that is undeniably delicious. All of this is wrapped up in tight, responsive controls and a solid frame rate despite the swarms of baddies that fill the game's small(ish) levels.

On the flipside, nonsensical story notwithstanding, the game offers little in the way of variety (and what it does proffer up feels decidedly tacked on, such as one level in which you're tasked to drive a vehicle merely because that's the new trend in shooters). For instance, you'll probably find yourself choosing your favorite weapons early on and sticking to them, and the game's incessant use of Reapers, scythe-wielding undead which are not only the first enemy you encounter but easily the most overused, detract from the overall experience. On top of this, the melee attack (ala Halo) is a little too powerful, and to conserve ammo and make quicker kills you'll probably find yourself bashing enemies in the face just as often as you shoot at them.

The game's single greatest offense, however, comes in terms of its length. This one can be finished with ease on the normal difficulty setting (albeit with one frustrating level near the end that tasks you with jumping through a fiery town killing flying Banshees). There is some slight replay value to be had due to a very gimmicky feature that allows you to make good or evil decisions, but it's just that - gimmicky, and really quite lifeless. The game plays out much the same in either case.

That said, there's still a lot to like about Darkwatch as a first person shootist. Expect the problems, deal with them, and you'll find a slick, fairly addictive action title just beneath the surface. It just had the potential to be so much more, and it's hard not to get the distinct impression that this one was rushed out the door before it could really mature into a grade A product.","""Dark"" one to Watch... with a wary eye",1129334400,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

I remember growing up playing the original and I recognize how important the original game is to gaming history and I was honestly concerned that the game was going to be an attempt at making a quick buck by milking old gamers with sweet whispers of nostalgia.

I was wrong.  This game is very good.  The graphic style holds true to the original but is a massive upgrade at the same time.  In terms of gameplay, it feels like Space Invaders mixed with Galaga/Galaxian and a huge case of attention deficit disorder.  The background effects, which feel inspired by cyberpunk culture and artwork, are energetic and entertaining without interfering with the gameplay.

Pros:
==> Classic Space Invaders gameplay that actually feels like the original game but brings something fresh and new to the table.
==> Exceptionally well designed retro artwork.  If more classic arcade remakes were like this game, arcade remakes wouldn't have a reputation of being mediocre shovel ware.
==> Energetic techno soundtrack that synchronizes with the actions you take in the game.
==> Challenging level progression

Cons:
==> None to speak of

The game is divided into 11 levels, each of which is broken up into a dozen or so mini-stages which last less than a minute.  It's pick up and play gaming at its finest.  The game is liberal with powerful power-ups which are dropped by aliens when you blast them apart in various combinations, but the abundance of powerups doesn't make the game a walk in the park by any stretch of the imagination.  The first several levels are fairly easy, but the difficulty is brutal at the higher levels.  Not impossible, but just hard enough to make you try over and over again and feel accomplished when you beat the gigantic pixelated space invader boss at the end.  As far as bosses go, this game has some of the best inspired boss battles I've seen out of almost any shooting game, and some of these boss battles can only truly be pulled off on the DS.

The PSP version is gorgeous looking, but in my opinion the DS is better in almost every department except graphics.  I haven't played much of the PSP version, but I suspect some of the coolest levels on the DS are left off on the PSP version because I just don't see how those levels would be possible on a single screen.

Its pretty much the same game as before so GTA3 players won't be as amazed as they were when they first played the game, but its still got some new little things that make it better then GTA3. Now you can smash cars, go inside shopping malls and dance clubs, dive out of moving cars, wreak mayhem on a golf course and more. The new weapons like Chainsaws, meat cleavers, hammers and samurai swords are pretty cool too! So its the same game with some cool new features.

I adorred the touching element not taken seriously in most games in the peasant version of each character and the royal version was motivating too.  The Human class has very little choice in background except as a wizard but the dwarf had the king and pauper choice and elf has many choices and dramatic differences in each.  The humans are intersting in that their ""mundain"" little insular sect in the world is like playing ""Siege of Avalon"" an action medival game with no fantasy yet the world beyond those human constructed walls is magical in nature here, unlike ""mount and blade"" or ""Siege"". Since each race has it's own agenda each race is more interesting to play as before I usually played only humans in Baldur's Gate and such as the other races had no real baring and I could not relate to a dwarf running around in Candlekeep or in the achademy at NWN. you will relate here to just what a dwarf is or an elf.(according to the rules of this particular game).  THose plots are race/class(as in noble/peasant) exclusive.  Humans have only the nobility and the wizard backgrounds.  If you don't like heavy dialogue and long history lessons about this ""Draconic"" world don't bother with the title if you don't like action and are into ""text adventrue"" don't bother with this title, it is very action oriented in many places along with the dialogue.

Spinter Cell: Double Agent finds Sam Fisher (once again superbly voiced by Michael Ironside) in a different set of surroundings.  He's under deep, very deep, cover this time around, as the Spinter Cell storyline takes a darker, grittier turn.  Sam is infiltrating a terrorist organization in these multi-layered missions, which you'll notice are pretty different from the ones found on the superior XBox 360 version.  That aside, Double Agent still offers the same kind of tried but true action/stealth gameplay that you all know and love.  The graphics are decent enough on the PS2, but what really helps sell this game are the excellent two player co-op missions and the multiplayer modes, which are tons of fun.  The online functions aren't packed with lag time either, which is a nice change of pace for a PS2 game.  The missions are lengthy enough to boot, which rounds out a sweet package.  The only real drawbacks for Double Agent is that this is basically the same Splinter Cell game that you've played before, and not much has changed since Chaos Theory and Pandora Tomorrow.  That aside though, this is still pure Splinter Cell all the way, and considering this is Sam Fisher's last foray on the PS2 (or any of the current-gen consoles for that matter), this is definitely worth picking up.",Sam Fisher on the PS2 for the last time,1165363200,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'},

Concept and Narrative
Lost Planet is a space shooter where the human race is fighting a war against an alien bug race for dominance over a new planet after Earth becomes uninhabitable. Not the most original concept, and I personally feel like I'm watching-playing an alternate version of Starship Troopers. The story is about a young man named Wayne, who after an encounter with an enormous insect known as the green-eye, has lost all memories, with the exception of his name and that the green-eye killed his father. Now Wayne is on a quest to destroy the green-eye, as well as regain his lost memories.

Gameplay
Third-person shooter, that's all there really is to say. Wayne can carry up to two kinds of guns and two different kinds of grenades. There are multiple pans between being close up to Wayne, far from Wayne, and even a first-person sight used to sniping. The big mechanic in the combat is the use of large Mechs called Vital Suits. There are many different kinds of VS's that due different things, but most carry two large weapons. Certain suits can hover in the air, others turn into snowmobiles.
The enemies, known as the Akrid range from large to small, but most are pretty easy to kill with large weakspot on certain places on their bodies. Other enemies are other humans known as Snow Pirates. Snow Pirates are also very weak unless fought in large numbers, but even then it's hard to die.
Boss fights can range between stupid easy to rediculously hard, though every boss has a certain weak point that, when hit right, tears them apart.

Overall
Lost Planet is a fun game with few boring sections and some fun bosses. However it does get monotonous and is basically just another game of running and gunning. Rent first then buy if you desire.","Not the most original, nor the most brilliant, but an enjoyable experience.",1278979200,,,

In each ""zone"" there is a load time, which gets old at 5-7 seconds each time. I don't know if I am just impatient (I am), or if it was actually a long load time.

There are mini games in each step in order to earn points which you can buy various machines and seeds to make the game go forward. The mini games get a bit old and I felt like I was abusing my screen on some of them (moving the stylus back and forth quickly to clean up an oil spill).

Also, the game is very short. I think it was 6 or 7 hours in my case.

I love the music. Weeks after I finished the game I still find myself humming the main tune.

Overall a fun game. There's not much to do after you beat the game but my 2 year old daughter likes walking around in the different zones and petting the animals that I've saved.

While the game system has generated so much buzz, it has also been proven to still be just as hard to sell to gamers with limited supply. That also could've been said with The Legend Of Zelda that way too. After the mammoth success of The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, many Wii owners have been anxious for a new way to play around with Link and all his missions against the vulgarous Ganon. That unfortunately, will have to wait awhile. But, there is a new add-on that can help you play around with Link for just a little while longer on the Wii, in a new way.

The new Wii Zapper is a sleek and convient device that turns your Wii remote and nunchuck controller, into a new handy gun peripheral, something Nintendo hasn't delivered since the original NES Zapper for Duck Hunt. The Zapper is easy to setup for any Wii owner and is convient to use with the new Resident Evil title. You can also use this with Link's Crossbow Training, a simple way to shoot out your bows against foes in Hyrule. The game plays well, as you play through 19 different levels to try to shoot at your opponents from demons, and other opponents. The graphics stand well, but the gameplay is actually very addictive to gamers young and old. The control is very simple to use, as you guide your Wii nunchuck controls around ad launch your arrows with a blink of an eye. It also unlike games like Dance Dance Revolution and Rock Band is a lot cheaper to buy, but keeps the peripherals at a affordable price.

All that I can say though is that I really am hoping the Wii Zapper doesn't fade into limited obscurity like other Nintendo add-ons like the DK Bongo Drums for Donkey Kong Jungle Beat from the Gamecube. As for Link's Crossbow Training, it follows well as a great game for solo play, or with multiplayer action that is worth while, but I just wish it could be a bit more challenging.

The dragon is pretty cool looking but the base feels kinda hollow and cheap.  The art book is pretty awesome.  I would have liked it more if they could have put a strategy guide in there somewhere(even if it was just on of those tiny ones you get with the world of warcraft box sets)

 as to the game itself there have been a few bugs.  My second playthrough of the game sawmy prisoner cart careen off the road and crash into the wall of the town we were heading to spin around and by the time the dude turned the cart around the door was closed and I had to start the game over.  Another time my brother was playing and while running up a tower to escape the mayhem in the courtyard the game glitched out and everyone was frozen, including the dragon that was supposed to be attacking the town.

 So far I have enjoyed the game but it seems a little too watered down compared to the previous games.  One of the joys of playing rpgs is building your stats. Like rich dudes collecting cars you want your dude to have allyour stats pumped up.  I remember obsessing on the art of powerleveling the right skills to get the maximum yield of stat points per level up.  Not sure if this game has stats but if they do they are wellhidden. Plus the lack of class creation is kinda a downer.  I want to be able to say this is what my dude is about right from the beginning.  Although most characters usually end up as a hybrid the more you play them anyway.  The menus are streamlined to help you get to the action quicker but to me it takes away a bit from the epicness of the game.  When you load up the game you get this rather sterile and minimalist title screen.  Is this it?  I thought.  It looks like a game demo screen not at all like the epic beginning of Oblivion.  That sort of stuff might fly in an nba 2k game but I wanted something more.  I'm still not sure about the spell system.  Unlike oblivion you 'equip' spells so it is hard to be a battlemage in this game.  (you can have a sword and a fistful of flame or flame and a shield but heaven help you if you want a shield, sword and a firespell at the ready.) Oblivion spoiled me a little in that regard.  I don't know I still have a lot of tinkering to do.  It's early days yet.

  Good news it that the character creator is less awkward and convaluted than in oblivion.  My main problem with the creator in that game was skin tone.  Make one little change and next thing you know you've got a dude with orange skin and a lumpy potato head.  The new system is much more conservative meaning the people you make will look fairly normal.(of course freaks are always possible if that's your thing)  It reminds me a little bit of the mass effect creator. This cuts both ways as the truly hardcore player wants more options than the slightly toned down menus which prevent from creating a completely unique dude.(Let's put it this way.  In oblivion I had a nord dude who was a dead ringer for the joker.  Let's leave it at that.)

  Combat is awesome of course.  That's the one area of the game that seems to get better every game in the series.  It would be almost laughable to play this and then go back to morrowind and it's clunky stiff hacking.  You get awarded with the occasional cinematic 'finish cam' if you pull off a spectacular attack like a critical hit.  It's quite neat.

 Overall, once the bugs are cleaned up I think this will be a great game even though I wouuld prefer a more hardcore game.  I suppose it was streamlined to appeal to more casual and mainstream players but I think more casual and mainstream players are going to be playing different games anyway.

Lost planet 2 could have been so much better then this. It almost feels like the programmers just quit working on it before it was done.

The career mode is almost over half Nevec.
They have a femme Fatal class that is not used in the main story.
The achievements will drive you to the internet.
They went to all the trouble of building up hype for Marcus and dom being in lost planet 2 but they are just appearance edits so they are not really in the game.

OK I get it, tell you some thing good about the game.
The VS robots are amazing in the game and a blast to operate.
The controls still handle as good as the first Lost Planet the roll evade control could use some tweaking tho.
The AI team bot intelligence most of the time is pretty dang good.

So now let's talk about guns, explosives and rocket launchers.
This is where Lost Planet 2 falls tragically short over the first one and most of the other games on the 360 that has weapons in it.
Almost every gun in the game just seems off on damage in some way.
They need to add a larger revolver to the game and move the fire effect and stats to that one.
Then reduce the damage and muzzle flash to the one in the game.
The machine guns do far to little damage for the size of the muzzle flash in the game. They either need to reduce the muzzle flash or increase the damage.
Snipers feel kind of off to me a critical hit does the right amount of damage but Non critical hits feel off to me.
The Hand cannon is amazingly spot on and the Heavy plasma cannnon feels about right to me.
I could go on, Just how off most of the weapons look and feel.
How ever the news is not all bad grenades are all perfect.

So how does character creation stack?
I will give this some slack after all this is the first Lost Planet with that feature.
Well Character creation is a short straw your parts are limited based on character type.
Plus your Class choice has no effect on cut scenes or dialog. With this being done they should of had all the parts available and used a different save system all together.
I hope they keep the character creation system and change how it's handled and re do career to instead had it where you choose the group and follow that one through the story. Instead of the career style in Lost Planet 2.
Parts choices are also a short order in Lost Planet 2 because the parts are separated by class with palette options if you play online expect to see other look a likes even in game there is a good chance you will see bots that look like your character.

Now if you look at the character class screen at some point they where clearly going to allow you to select a created character for the 2nd player off line mode too. But that got left out too.

So in the end Lost Planet 2 is jem of a game even with it feeling incomplete.

When I remove it to show family members who are curious about the Vita, I plug it back in and all the bubbles moved.  Annoying.

So I get it.  Not all memory cards have exactly the amount of GB's they say on it.  My 4 GB memory stick actually has 3.82 GB's.  This memory card has 3 GB's less than what they advertise.  You truly only have 29 GB.

I know this has nothing to do with the actual memory card's performance, but it does hurt the Vita. The price.  I think there are 2 reasons that the Vita struggles (I happen to love my Vita and think everyone should get one) First reason is the PSP.  People didn't like the PSP Go (I think) and they are not going to buy a Vita because of it.  Good job Sony.  The second reason it is failing is because of the memory card prices.  When i bought this memory card it was like $75.  It has gone up in price.  Well done Sony.  Anyways you are basically forced to buy the 32 if you only want 1 memory card, even then you may need 2.

Thank you to anyone who read this whole thing :P",Great Memory Card.,1375488000,,{'Edition:': ' 32 GB'},

4.0,False,"01 17, 2009",A10ATTBZX4YY4O,B000XJNTNS,Lothe,"Mario Kart Wii follows the established pattern for the Mario Kart games: pick a character from the Nintendo ranks, from Mario or Donkey Kong to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Galaxy-s/dp/B000FQ9QVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Galaxy's</a>&nbsp;Rosalina, then go head-to-head in kart races on wacky tracks based on Nintendo games.

Nintendo's don't-fix-what-ain't-broke attitude could be called conservative, but it also means the game has built-in appeal for players who enjoyed previous Mario Kart games.  The Wii version does introduce a significant new element in the form of motorcycles.  Bikes drift a little easier than karts (but with less power) and can do wheelies to gain speed in straightaways.  In a word, they're not revolutionary, but they add a little room for players to develop their own racing style.

Also present are the requisite new tracks.  There are four new cups and four ""retro"" cups that resurrect tracks from previous games.  The retro tracks run the gamut from the original SNES Mario Kart to selections from the GameCube and DS versions.  The recreated tracks strike an intriguing balance between having a nice Wii sheen and maintaining the graphical style of the systems they first appeared on.  The new tracks are more of a mixed bag.  Some, such as Toad's Factory and Mushroom Gorge, present fun and interesting new concepts.  Others, like the new Bowser's Castle, are elegant refinements of classic themes.  Frustrating, however, are so-called ""new"" tracks that blatantly crib from older ones, such as Moon View Highway, which is a dead ringer for Toad's Turnpike (N64).

Most perplexing of all is the handling of items.  Falling off the course, getting hit with a thunderbolt or blue shell, and other sundry events all now cause you to lose an item you're holding.  In races haunted by the possibility that you may be robbed of your item at any moment, item strategy goes out the window.  There is a strong disincentive to hold on to an item and use it at an opportune time; instead, you want to use it as soon as you get it so as to get some benefit instead of just having it taken away.  This system may be a deliberate move on Nintendo's part to strip away a layer of complexity and thereby make the game that much more accessible to neophytes, but it is ultimately to the game's detriment.  All this is not even to mention the greatly increased incidence of high-powered items like blue shells, which you may now see several times per race.

The solid core gameplay redeems most of the flaws of Mario Kart Wii, and even the game's shortcomings may be less than apparent to new players.  The ""next generation"" has not spurred a quantum leap forward for the series, but as a new iteration of a reliable franchise, Mario Kart Wii does not disappoint.

Not bad at at all. The character controls very smoothly except for when you have to lock on. then it sometimes goes bananas & locks on to regular civlians lol

but anyways... big map. tons of collectibles if you're into that.
tons of upgrades for the main character.
the music was repetitive, but thanks to my ipod classic, I can travel through the city in style.
the enemies are repetitive but it gets crazy & thats exciting when either the military or monsters are chasing you LOL
plus this was a very early game. the graphics won't blow your mind.

I didn't even do the side missions, cause the main game gave me tons of POINTS to upgrade my powers.
I did start collecting those with memories so I can find out more about the origins of it all.
That kept me interested & busy. the plot in those flashback is pretty GOREY believe it or not.

I honestly expected solid garbage that I could laugh at for an hour or so and move on.  But what I found was a surprisingly competent action game.  You play a Tarantula and a Scorpion alternatively throughout the story . . . of which there is a surprisingly good one!  Seriously, there is an entire Coen Brothers-esque story going on in the background featuring the voices of Billy Bob Thornton and Dennis Hopper!  You, as the Tarantula and Scorpion, kind of observe the story as it goes on around you for most of the game (with a few moments where you do play a direct part) while playing through a sort of parallel 'story' wherein the Tarantula and Scorpion consistently cross paths with each other.

Think about any movie you've ever seen where at some point (usually the climax) there is an insect-ex-machina where the main villain gets bit by a snake or stung by a scorpion and it throws them off enough for the hero to save the day . . . now imagine that you are instead watching a movie about that creature's life in the days leading up to that climax . . . that's this game!

4.0,False,"08 12, 2009",AWPP6EHM9WSFO,B000ZK7ZK8,Siege,"This game surprised me.  How long ago was the last Ghostbusters movie made?  The 1980s?  Out of nowhere comes a game based on that license.  I expected yet another disappointing licensed game, but from the opening credits to the ending credits Ghostbusters sets the bar for the movie-based game genre.  It is just that good.
You play the new mute recruit to the Ghostbusters team.  You've started your new job just as another paranormal crisis starts in New York City.  The story ties nicely into the first film and makes a few nods to the second one.  Through the course of the game you re-visit a few familiar locations from the movies.  Yes, this is fan service. The game's script is written by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd.  Thankfully, they have crafted the script in such a way that you never fell like you are retreading old ground.  If anything it helps reinforce the feeling that you are playing through the third ghostbusters movie.  If you loved the movies, then you need to play this game.  The story is awesome.
All of the original actors from the movies do a great job voicing their respective characters.  The dialogue is spot-on.  It is a nice touch to hear Ray or Egon shouting words of encouragement when you do well.
You get to use all of the trademark Ghostbusters' equipment.  Wrangling and trapping ghosts is exactly how it should be.  Using the googles helps you see spooks and hidden secrets.  I enjoyed all of the in-game collectibles and the creative way you find them.  The same PKE meter you use to track down ghosts also helps track down the various collectible paranormal objects which get displayed back in the Ghostbusters headquarters.  You gain several creative ""weapons"" to take down the ghosts.  Most work well.  The only real nod to the second film is the use of the slim gun.  It works for the purpose of the plot, but feels out of place with all the other cool ""weapons"" at your disposal.
As much as I hate to say it, I suggest playing this game on the easy level for the best experience.  Higher difficulty levels pump up the health of the various ghosts so far that it takes far too long to wrestle them into a trap.
Another downside is how dumb your A.I. teammates are.  You never really die in this game.  You just get knocked out and wait for your teammates to revive you.  Sometimes it works, but there will be other times you will cuss at the screen as all of the other ghostbusters also get knocked out causing a ""game over"" screen.
Most of the other game mechanics work, but feel a little generic.  Remember the star of this game is story, not the mechanics.
Multiplayer makes an appearance.  It is serviceable, but nothing special.  The standard modes make an appearance and are fun.  They are just nothing special.
I rate Ghostbusters at an 8.5 out of 10.  It is a worthwhile addition to anyone's video game library.",Fan service done right.,1250035200,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",
4.0,False,"01 12, 2011",AGCEZ20IHFDPA,B002DC8GWC,R. P. Jesus,"What really makes Sakura Wars special is the Live Interactive Picture System (LIPS). LIPS lets you pick what you say and ultimately change the course of the game to one of six different endings. I know that might not seem so unique now that gamers have been spoiled by BioWare, but since there are no BioWare RPGs on the Wii I think more than just anime fans could find this campy game highly enjoyable.

Of course being an anime fan doesn't hurt. Voltron fans in particular will appreciate the premise but be warned the ""MECHA Action!"" does take a back seat to the drama. The flow of the game feels reminiscent of Snatcher or Policenauts, except Sakura Wars follows a formula. You'll deal with a new dilemma in each chapter that will end in a tactical battle. But you'll have to navigate over an hour of dialogue before you see any action. (That is, unless you stumble into the hot tub area.)

Although, I found most of the girls in this game scary! (How's that for realism?) I spent my time trying not to say or do anything that would give them the wrong idea (no ""hadaka no tsukiai""). I did have a lot of fun dodging them,  though. This could be a whole new direction for the series, ""Sakura Wars 6: Let's Just Stay Friends.""

The combat has been compared to a bare bones Valkyria Chronicles. It's simple enough but if you don't pay attention you can die quickly. Not to worry though, you can simply restart not far from where you failed. Battles can take about 30-45 minutes. So show up to play!

I enjoyed the game with the classic controller. It worked great except I still had to use the Wiimote to point at the screen from time to time (same deal with Monster Hunter Tri). I'm not wild about switching back and forth.

At first I didn't know what to think of Sakura Wars, but after I finished one chapter I was hooked. The next sixteen hours went by too fast for me. It's a good thing this game encourages multiple play-throughs. In fact,  there's no way to see everything the first time around. If you're into RPGs or anime and looking for something to enjoy until Last Story gets here, don't miss out on Sakura Wars--it's already becoming harder to find.

Before, starting with the actual review, it is necessary to warn people before buying:

1. Have a BEASTLY computer. Seriously- mine never lags for any online game, but it is really slow on CIV 4.. and it sometimes crashes.

2. Many people with ATI Radeon and NVDIA (not sure of the types for both. I have NVDIA GEForce4 440X it works fine) experience an error during the install. The latest patch supposedly fixed that, but I still hear complaints.

3. I also hear that Firaxis ships 2 install discs or 2 play discs and this happens often

4. My install disc is actually the play disc and the play AND the install disc. My play disc does nothing. Just thought it was weird.

Now:

The Pros!

1. Graphics are a step up from CIVIII

2. Extremely addictive... almost dangerously

3. Unit animations are particularly well done such as the grenadiers and Aztec Jaguars

4. I really enjoyed the scenarios which are WWII Desert War, EArth 1000AD, Ice Age, Ancient Greek World, American Revolution.

5. Rather balanced- there is no superior civilization etc.

6. Diplomacy is drastically improved and there are some funny (and some lame like when Julius Caesar says ""would you like some salad... I made it myself).

7. A difficulty level for everyone

8. Unit promotion system very well done. In the system, your units gain certain promotions if they win enough battles like ""city raider"" which increases your units ""strength"" when attacking cities.

9. Very strategic based. If you like thinking and planning ahead and overall organization, this will be great for you.

10. Combat system is balanced

11. Problems like Infinite City Sprawl and Pollution from CIVIII were eliminated.

12. Specialist (for cities) are fun to use, but confusing sometimes.

13. Many ways to win

14. Great People system is well done. When you put specialists and wonders in your city, it generates Great People Points (GPP) which can spawn a: Great engineer, prophet, merchant, artist, scientist who can do good things for your civilization.

Cons

1. Graphics aren't outstanding, and the leaders look stupid (No comment on Gandhi and Louis XIV's hair...)

2. Slow on anyones computer and there is a threat of crashes (luckily autosave is enabled)

3. some combat oddities still exist like knights beating helicopters

4. Religion really doesn't play that much of a factor.

5. I would like a greater diversity in units. There's only like 5 different kinds of boats.

6. Attacking is very difficult especially if you are technologically backwards due to very high bonuses to defence units.

7. Can get very tedious

and the most important con: VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE. The instruction manual isn't very healful, but the tutorial is and is you play the first few games on settler (easiest difficulty), you should get the hang of it.

4.0,True,"11 6, 2009",A2F0E69BAX0T0T,B001IK1BWC,Dan Leithauser,"In a prior review, I indicated that there were significant problems with the combat system --mostly due to the fact that I was not used to this type of strategy control based type game.  You see, for someone who just started playing recent PC games in late 2008, this type of D&D strategy with complete control over team actions was confusing and complicated.  The games I had played were more FPS, where control was direct and I guess, if you will, hack and slash.  Dragon Age threw me for a curve.

Well I wrote the review and was kindly flamed.  Yes, the criticism was merited.  Although I still think EA's advertisements and marketing were pushing this game to Fallout 3, Oblivion, and even Halo fans.  A little more research on my part probably would have made me avoid Dragon Age, realizing that this game is not like any of those games.  Oblivion has similar atmosphere, but Oblivion's control system is strictly FPS (or third person) -- not strategy based team fighting.  Avoiding Dragon Age would have been a mistake on my part -- I would have missed a lot of fun.  I deleted my prior review and wrote a new one.

With that said, and some tender commentary flames licking my boots, I persevered and played to learn what all the great reviews were all about.  What I have discovered is that Dragon Age is a very fun role playing game with detailed and spectacular graphics which immerse a player in a fantastic story line that is just complicated enough to hold attention and keep you playing.

Some of the battling requires little planning, and I found the key-more difficult battles fun to lose a couple of times to find the strategy that works.  As with most battle oriented games it pays to avoid overwhelming odds and draw fights into managed bits, Dragon Age takes this a bit further especially when you have to coordinate movements and actions of people by periodic pausing, and even changing strategy mid-battle.  For someone not used to this system, it did come easier with time.  I was pleasantly surprised that even if I died and moved into another character -- as long as one of us won in the end, all of us would come back (with some injury, but still back to life!).  I like this type of recovery in a game.

As for the cinematic immersion that makes this game great, Dragon Age runs just fine on my laptop running on Vista 64 with 4 gigs of RAM, and a Nvidia 9800m GS graphics card.  I can run Dragon Age at the highest graphic settings available without stuttering, lockups or other obvious problems.... As far as I can tell, Dragon Age was fully vetted prior to release--there have been no unrecoverable errors or game shut downs.  Action or cutaway scenes all run perfectly.

There are still times when I struggle to control the camera angles or playing field, but in my view, it is certainly better to have that level of control than let the AI choose.  I am glad I tried this type of game, even though I was initially frustrated.  For people that are more confused than I was, or find the game complicated, I would give you the same gentle flames that drew me closer to the fire -- keep playing and learning -- you may find Dragon Age to be one of the most fun games you will play in 2009-2010.",Fantastic Fun but initially frustrating,1257465600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The only complaint I have about the gameplay is the camera angle manipulation.  You look around by tilting the control around.  It's effective for a realistic view range of what you'd be able to see in RL, but it's difficult to control when chasing a specter with your proton-blaster around the room....kind of dizzying and easy to over-pan, etc.  It'd be nice if there was a 'scrolling' sensitivity slidebar control, much like there is for your mouse on the computer.

I downloaded and installed a player-made mod called ""BttR"" and it added two new professions (Necromancer/Banker) and many items, while fixing some of the bugs in the original scripts.  This, I think, improved the game significantly.

Pros -
+ Interesting Plot; the American colonial setting and interaction with American historical figures was a nice change
+ Graphics; outstanding graphics
+ Game Play; good controls, easy to master especially if you have played the earlier games
+ Solid Ending; nothing hanging, which was a pleasant surprise

Cons -
+ Too Short; finished the main game in three sessions
+ Side Missions; sort of pointless and didn't add much to the game

This was fun to play and was overall enjoyable, and I liked seeing the progression of Connor's abilities and involvement in ""historical events"" throughout the game.

4.0,True,"06 6, 2008",A1ETMNKF9HO2TJ,B000XJNTNS,ahw,"Mario Kart for the Wii sticks to the tried and true Mario Kart franchise formula for fun racing and casual multiplaying.  The strengths of the franchise regrettably come with the same annoyances of the prior installments - punishing rubber band AI.

Rubber band AI is Mario Kart's way of leveling the playing field for novice computer opponents and also applies to other players.  In a nutshell, the game discriminates against skilled players.  It does this by providing more powerful items to players (both human and computer) that are behind in the race.  A first place player is hard pressed to get anything other than fake item boxes, bananas and green shells, whereas the player in last place is far more likely to get POW boxes, lighting bolts, bullet bills and the like.

The benefit of rubber band AI is that my friends who've never played the game before can jump in and be competitive.  The downside is that it is maddeningly infuriating to play single player against the computer.  You WILL experience a race where you are in first place for the entirety of the race only to be struck by a blue shell and subsequently paralyzed by repeated red shell bombardments.  One questions the logic behind the blue shell item (an item that automatically takes out whoever is in first place): is it fun playing a game that is so obviously ""race-ist"" against first place (har har - sorry).

The game is still fun, but you'd think that after so many iterations of the Mario Kart franchise, Nintendo would wise up and allow some customization of race options - such as toggling on/off items to your liking or setting items to ""true"" random distribution instead of favoring lower placed racers.  This flexibility would allow me to play a multiplayer race based on pure ""skill"" against fellow Mario Kart pros, while retaining the ability to simplify for casual games with novice friends.

The lack of options is even more glaring in ""battle"" mode - where you are forced to play red vs. blue two team matches.  And unused multiplayer spots are filled by computer players.  Again, IMO, it's absolutely inexcusable to not include the option to set the total number of players on the field, number of players per team, number of teams, etc.

Alas, Nintendo once again has favored simplicity over function - as is a consistent theme for the company.  Much like how I wish the Wii had more robust networking capability, much like Xbox Live, regrettably Nintendo insists on keeping it's console simple, compact, and censored.  I can't even type custom messages to opponents when I play them online!  Give me a headset Nintendo!  Sheesh!",Casual Fun But Lack of Options Keeps It From Greatness,1212710400,4,,
4.0,True,"11 22, 2013",A148F4ZOSD82OW,B00DE2W4PK,SirPasta117,"First off both Amazon and Sony did not do a very good job at packing this expensive device up. The actual PS4 is only support by cardboard, and Amazon was quite stingy with the protective bubbles and half of the bubbles were deflated by the time it got to my door step. Luckily I received mine with no issues.

The PS4 itself is quite simply gorgeous. It has a sleek angular profile with hard lines and concealed buttons and ports. It can easily blend into an existing entertainment cabinet, but at the same time its still eye catching thanks to the angled edges. My only complaint is minor. The power button sits right between the glossy plastic and matte plastic and the glossy plastic loves thumbprints. Fairly minor issue, but still a slight annoyance for people like myself that hate to see oil thumbprints.

The controller is without a doubt the best Playstation controller yet. It has a good weight to it, all of the buttons and triggers have excellent tactile response, and the thumbsticks are a vast improvement thanks to the right on the edge. Sadly there are a few things Sony need to work on. First off, the battery life is abysmal. A puny 6-8 hours of battery life is unacceptable in this day and age and I blame it squarely on the constantly glowing lightbar. The lightbar is mainly an addition that only works with the sold separately camera. There are a few other uses for the light bar, such as telling multiple players which character they are, or showing a characters health, but due to the inward angle the lightbar lies you have to tilt the controller toward you in order to see it and taking your eyes off the game. My other complaint was the trackpad, its a good idea on paper but was poorly designed. Its simply too small for anything useful other than quick swipes. Its curves over the top of the controller so its difficult to tell where the touch sensitive part ends by touch.

As for Killzone I really enjoyed it. Its without a doubt the best looking game available for the PS4, and arguable available period. The particle effects look fantastic, and levels are diverse and looks amazing. It carries over the same sound effects from previous Killzone titles. The pings, clicks, and thuds are very unique to the Killzone universe and are quite pleasant to listen to. Story wise the game struggles. It feels like each level is trying to show off some new graphical tech and the story takes back seat. Then again the Killzone story was nothing really ever anything to write home about, I doubt there are many fans invested into the story lines and characters. The abrupt ending strongly hints at a sequel. Now that the developers have shown off all of the new graphical improvements perhaps they can take some time and work on the story.

All in all I am quite pleased with this bundle. New hardware, a killer title, and $10 cheaper than buying everything separate. This was a no brainer for me.

4.0,False,"07 7, 2001",ATVD3TLOXJRI9,B00004S9AC,Amazon Customer,"That's right this RPG is good. Although overshadowed by the famous Final Fantasy series (it's so sad that so many good RPG's are overshadowed by some of SquareSoft's bad ones) it stands on two strong feet. It plays kinda like SaGa Frontier one put not really. There are 3 characters, Ashley, Brad, and Lilke and you choose which character to play as as you go through the game. However your character will keep changing until all three get together to form one party. The battle system is ok, not great. The basic enemies become very easy to kill in one turn making this a relatively easier game.  The bosses have been divided up into different hit zones, a la Vagrant Story. If you ""kill"" a sub-part of the boss you get extra experience and money than if you just killed it outright. A nice idea. If a boss is giving you trouble you can just kill it quickly or you can lengthen the battle by taking it out piece by piece. When it loses a body part it also loses an attack. Players will be reminded of the Reactor battle in Parasite Eve 2. The Boss battles, however, have a nasty tendency to be fairly easy as well.  There are special attacks that the character can do when it gets enough FP and these can be cool or they can be really dumb. It's your decision. The nice thing about FP though is that it doesn't go away if you use a simple skill, only if you use one of the four character skills and your base starting FP goes up with your level. Example: at level 23 when a battle starts you will have 23 FP. Some I never understood why they were there so I never used them. Wild Arms also has summoned monsters in the form of creatures called Mediums that you attach to your character and you can summon them in battle if a certain character was in your party. The music is really cool. There is a nice spanish-sounding trumpet during the beginning anime of the game. Although I think only music lovers will know what a spanish trumpet sounds like. The only negative about the music is that the tracks are awfully repetitive to the point where it repeats itself ever 20-30 seconds. Bad parts. Game really should be analog not digital. I have a strong belief that RPGs and action games should be analog now-a-days and anything less is kinda sad. I would understand if it was made in 1998 or 1999 but this was made in 2000, late 2000 if I remember correctly not only that but the game is in XenoGears-like 3-D. Analog is not an option but a nessecity. Other than the control, the items should of been described. Some are self explanatory (gee I wonder what a healing nut does?) other's you sit and look and go ""I don't know what that does."" They really should of described the items rather than forcing you to hold the triangle button, since it doesn't prompt you on the screen to press it for describtion. There is also a system called searching. Towns, castles, dungoens and what-have-you are not shown on screen.  You have to find them using a little dinky radar-type thing.  This could make things go on forever if you have to search out a town in a giant desert (this does happen too).  And now for a random thought. All the bosses have really cool names attached to them. Like, 'The Garanguatuan Little Piggy Eater Grandol.' This one's made up but that is what they look like. I just thought that it was funny. Why don't other game bosses have funny names? (stupid question I know).",An RPG from Sony that's good.,994464000,,,

4.0,False,"08 19, 2004",A21I83YY8UA97L,B0001AN1GY,Rodney Fix,"The third installment of the Thief series finds Garret back in the shadows. This is known as a `stealth' game, meaning creep around in the shadows a lot, taking people down like an assassin. Which makes the game play somewhat slower in pace, but allows for a richer story line to be absorbed.

Rather than slap together a few cut scenes with some trite dialog that gives you a thinly veiled reason for going from A to B, Thief has a rich backdrop of a story that pushes the game along as you find answers that uncover new questions. Lots of side missions are melded seamlessly into the overall story so it's all just part of a thief's life. Picking pockets and stealing loot and then having to fence them to gain the cash to buy more supplies adds a small RPG element (the more loot you steal, the better equipped you can enter the missions). A nice selection of weapons are offered: Water Arrows (to put out the torches and make more shadow), Moss Arrows (to cut down the sound of footsteps), Fire Arrows (to do some lethal damage) are among the more unique. Add in some flashbombs, gas bombs, the requisite health viles and some other goodies to fill out your arsenal. The foes get scarier and creepier as the game progresses and almost approaches a horror/survival atmosphere.

Thief 3 makes a good balance of forcing you to take some degree of stealth. You can kill most bad guys, but attract more than one or two and its flee or die.

Story: 4/10
Alpha Worms infest the human population, turning them into violent and deadly mutants.  The Worms can also create giant Godzilla sized monsters for epic boss battles.  You play an American Ninja who's father was Japanese, but was created in a lab, and there's some mention of your mother...  Umm... you're basically a video game character designed to kill monsters!  That's pretty much all you need to know.  The story doesn't make much sense and the dialogue is more befitting of a surfer movie than an epic action film.

Gameplay: 8/10
There are 3 types of gameplay in Ninja Blade and all are fun.
1. Hack and Slash Sword Fighting and Ninja Magic vs. Zombies and Bosses
This is the core of the game.  There are 3 weapon types (katana, massive heavy sword, and fast twin blades) and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses.  There are a fair amount of combos for each weapon and the combat is fluid and complete with finishing moves.  You also get elemental Ninja Magic for fighting enemies and using the environment to your advantage.  All of your weapons and magic can be upgraded by collecting orbs found in the environments or by killing enemies.

2. Quicktime Events
Reminiscent of Dragon's Lair, a crazy action scene plays and you press the right button at the right time to keep the sequence going.  If you mess up, it's ok, the scene rewinds a few seconds and you can keep trying until you get it right.  These action scenes are so over the top... It's like watching a Popeye cartoon if Popeye had 10 cans of Spinach...  It's like a Jason Statham Movie x 100... We're talking Superman on meth!  They're so ridiculous, you can't take them seriously; but they still manage to be fun.  (Mostly because the game doesn't overpunish you by killing you if you make a mistake.)  Also, if you have having trouble with these, you can adust the Quicktime Difficulty on the Options Menu!

3. Rail Shooter
There are some scenes in the game where you're on a helicopter or vehicle, firing a .50 cal machine gun or rocket launcher.  These scenes are very exciting and pretty easy.  Simply put... FUN.

The game mixes all 3 types of gameplay fairly often and it keeps the game from feeling stale.  If you die, Checkpoints are fairly generous and you can continue at the last one.  At the end of each of the 9 Missions, you get a score based on how well that you did.  THIS IS THE ONLY TIME THE GAME SAVES.  Unfortunately, you can't save during a Mission.  (Each Mission is about 60-30 minutes.)

Sound/Music:  6/10
The explosions and roars of the giant mosters are LOUD, and the sound contributes to the action, but the soundtrack is pretty weak.  It's almost as if the team was finishing the game and somebody said, ""Hey, we should put some music in here.""  The background music is just there.  Some tracks are exciting and others are bad.  One of them sounds like a guy with a saxophone is in an electric chair.  (If you played the game, you know what I'm talking about.)

Art:  8/10
The art is pretty good overall.  From the visual effects, to the character designs, to the Tokyo Skyline, the graphics and animations are all very good.

Overall: 7/10
The game is fun and it doesn't try to be anything else.

Ninja Blade is Rated M for Violence and Gore.

If you're looking for a fun action game that's not too hard, this is it.  With a Shadow of the Colossus Soundtrack, a Real Story, and Less Silly Action Scenes, this could have been in the same league as God of War.  Unfortunately, the game is more 'action cartoon comedy' than epic masterpiece.  Because the game is fairly short, the hero is completely forgettable, and replay value is limited, this makes a great rental.

4.0,False,"03 30, 2004",A1XTCBK96T6MSL,B0000C4E7P,tuesday next,"I'd have to say that I really enjoyed playing this game despite some flaws. The graphics are really well done even though it is raining through the entire second half of the game. It took me about four days to play this game (maybe four to six hours at a time) so you don't feel let down that the game is too short. It's pretty morbid with lots of dead bodies, a decapitation and a suicide. I'd have to say it's the first time I've seen a character vomit (well you don't actually SEE it) in a computer game. There are numerous locales, characters to interrogate and secret passageways to explore. Your character spends a lot of time in cemeteries and a morgue. There are also (unfortunately) plenty of situations where the main character can be killed off - SAVE OFTEN.
Here's what I didn't like - the dialogue is somewhat stilted. It seems to take a lot of time for the characters to say their spiel and there is quite a bit of dialogue (but nothing on the scale of the Longest Journey). Even though the graphics are really well done, the actual characters are always seen from a distance so you never see their faces. This makes them seem a little wooden. Another problem is that you sometimes have to wait around to get a character to give you information that you asked for. Your character has to wander around and return at least two or three times before the other character has the info available. This seems quite a waste of time. The other problem is that some items need to be left-clicked on and others need to be right-clicked on. There's no rhyme or reason to this.

4.0,False,"04 12, 2005",A1JTOBODFHVJPG,B00005BR6H,Legacyman77,"This game is the first of the Dragonball Z Budokai series. It features all the characters from the Saiyan Saga, to the Cell Games Saga. You can also go through the story of Dragonball Z using the Story mode (this is also how you unlock most of the characters). The other two characters you have to get by beating the World Tournament stage.

Cons:

1. If you don't like fighting games this is not for you

2. If you don't want to keep pressing the same button combinations all the time, I'd suggest one of the later games in the series.

3. It only goes to the Cell Games Saga

4. It leaves out the Garlic Jr. Saga (just in case some of you were wondering)

Pros:

1. It's based on the show, so if you're a fan you'll like it

2. If you have some of the other games or if you are thinking about getting one of them this is a good way to train yourself with the controls.

3. This is the only game in which you get to play as either Android 19, Zarbon, or Dodoria (in case you wanted to know if there are any secondary characters in the game)

4. This is the only game in which the characters aren't Cell shaded (although in Dragonball Z Budokai 3 they fixed up the job a little)

4.0,False,"09 1, 2008",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000XJK40O,Cloud,"Despite the fact that they are not usually my genre, I found survival horror games to be the most affecting as far as emotions. Some games which have emotional cutscenes pass by with nary a tear and some games with topics that should hit home don't do much of anything. But play a character stuck in a haunted mansion or a dilapitated town filled with creepy residents and it's bound to get your heart racing. With a brand new PS3 in tow and not wanting it to be like the Wii (read: used only for occasional play moments and not every game that gets released), I thought I'd check out this one. And despite some gripes as well as a weird bug, this is still one atmospheric and violent game.

Story: Taking place almost a year after the events of Condemned: Criminal Origins (still just Xbox360), Agent Ethan Thomas has his the bottle hard and is having visions and nightmares. Not only that but the town's occupants have gone a bit...crazy and have started to beat each other up. When his former mentor Vanhorn leaves a call for help, Ethan is sent to investigate which will also bring to light some other mysteries and people behind the scenes.

The first half of the story is great and really delves into this idea of a supremely harsh detective story (an even grungier looking ""Seven"" if you can believe it) but then things go a little nuts and the plot takes a sharp turn and it becomes silly and new ideas are introduced that kind of ruin the whole thing. While you do want to play through till the end, it's still going to be looked back on as the ""good half"" and ""everything up to the end"".

Graphics: When you're dealing with a high-end television set, I love games like Uncharted: Drake's Fortune or Ratchet and Clank where the sharpness and vibrancy of the graphics will make things stand out. However, Condemned is the opposite route with lots of blacks and browns (and red of course) and it's a more ""murky"" looking title. That doesn't mean it looks bad cause it looks fantastic from detail to lighting to character animation. And having it entirely from Ethan's viewpoint helps since climbing up ladders actually shows hands and feet and not just the wall going up or down.

Sound/Music: First a bit of noting: on the Ps3, some have mentioned this idea of a crackling sound that's heard that I found is even more audible in the menus. While it's not detrimental to the gameplay, it is distracting and kind of ruins the sound a bit. Which is too bad cause the score here is atmospheric, atonal and quite creepy and the voice acting is also fantastic including a role by MGS's Roy Campbell as your boss. Also very much welcome is the sound design which plays into the combat. Hitting enemies with fists or weapons gets that awesome crack and impact sound that will sure to rattle your teeth and make your jawbone flinch.

Gameplay: I have to be honest: I kind of hate first-person shooters. Sure I can handle the occasional one like Bioshock or something but for the most part they turn me off. Condemned though uses for the most part an emphasis on melee (guns gets a bigger appearance unfortunately later on). Many items can be found in your travels from pipes to wrenches to crowbars, bricks that you can toss at people. Couple times I even found toilet seats. Using the L1 or R1 buttons is for your left and right fists respectively while holding them is for blocking. If you punch with both fists one after the other, you can activate a combo which deals bigger damage. Pressing the R3 button brings a kick (perfect for hitting enemies that ****ed you off after you killed them) while L3 and a punch will bring a hook. The problem is that enemies can frequently hit which cancels out any combos you're trying for and bizarrely they seem to take a lot of hits before they're dead. I can smack a guy 5 times with an aluminum baseball bat and he still gets up. What the hell?

But getting the kill move is the satisfying part and this game brings to the table an ""environmental kill"". Basically if an opponent gets stunned, pressing L1 and R1 and you'll put them in a choke hold where you can snap their neck but if you're feeling particularly vindictive, you can look around the room for an icon where you can kill them in a move unique to that place. One move I put the guy's head against the door frame and proceeded to kick his head against it. Ouch. Another I found a vice and well, let's just say he got more than a migraine coming.

There's also some investigative parts which show up which are fun though sometimes I felt without a walkthrough, there was no way I could've answered some of these questions. You get a UV light to follow blood trails and hidden messages, a spectrometer for locating emitters (""noisy hubcaps"" as Yahtzee calls em), cameras and a GPS. The actual investigating only happens in specific parts so you're not going to be CSI'ing your way the whole level.

While I didn't lose sleep after playing this, there is some particularly nasty parts and some of the special kills are totally brutal and that's nothing compared to the brutality that comes from smacking people with pipes in the face and despite the sound gripe, this is certainly a worthwhile game to play even if it goes haywire at the end.","A moody, brutal brawler",1220227200,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

Anyways, I thought the 3-D environments were interesting, and easier to navigate due to their sparse nature. They gave the game the not so distant future feel. What was difficult was when you actually fought. The controls are a bit aggrivating, and the enemies skill at exploiting that fact get better with each level. You can forget about using weapons at long ranges until you get either the rail-gun like weapon, or the screaming cannon thingy. The screaming cannon is one of the more creative innovations in weapons I have seen in games. Basically you shoot it at your target, and it stalks the poor person as it drains them of life. Some victims actually whimper, and say things like I don't want to die.

Pros: The bundle comes with both a rumble pak and a controller pak (or memory card). How cool is that? If you're buying stuff off of Amazon, it saves you about four dollars in shipping fees. What's better is how cheap the Tremor Pak Plus is now. If you snoop around, you can get this bundle new for the price you'd pay for a either individual product by itself!

As for the actual rumbling, it works pretty awesomely. I've tried it out on Perfect Dark and Madden 99 so far. It's got high and low settings. True N64 players use high for maximum vibration! :)

The memory card is the same size as the controller pak Nintendo originally made. Alas, it is not bundled with some of the larger memory cards that InterAct produced. But most games will easily fit onto the 123-page card.

Cons: The Tremor Pak Plus is both larger and heavier than the Rumble Pak produced by Nintendo, not to mention the original Tremor Pak produced by InterAct. This is because it has an additional slot to stick a memory card into the Tremor Pak. Presumably, InterAct thought people would like it, since it allowed them to use a controller pak and a rumble pak at the same time. Nice thought on their part, but the original Tremor Pak is, as a consequence, much sleeker and even more desirable than this improved version.

In summation, I sort of wish Interact had just given us a bundle with the original Tremor Pak and a 123-page memory card, as opposed to this bulky contraption with a slot. Even so, I'd totally recommend this bundle to anyone whose interested in the gracefully aged console that is the N64.","A little bulky, but it does its job well.",1312848000,,,
4.0,False,"05 30, 2011",A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B003VUO6H4,Strategos,"I've been gaming since the days of the NES. My favorite Game Consoles are the Dreamcast, the Saturn, and the Playstation 2 (mostly for the PlayStation 1 Games). I currently own every one of ""The Big Three"", the Wii, the PS3, and the Xbox 360. Oh, and I write a lot of game reviews. For fun. I've wanted a PS3 for a long time, just because I've been curious. I wanted a Blu Ray Player to see the difference between Blu Ray and DVD, and I've wanted to try some of the PS3 exclusive games. This year I finally saved up my money, and bought a used PS3. My thoughts?

The Wii is a toy, not a game console. It has the WORST online store I have ever seen as far as design goes (you have to enter your credit card EVERY time you make a purchase) and the BEST as far as selection (it's worth buying a Wii just for the Turbo Graphics shooters if like me you are a serious retro gamer). The Xbox 360 is a Gamer and Home Theater Enthusiast's dream come true (except the lack of Blu Ray and 1080p). And the PS3...is....interesting.

After navigating the menus and going through the options in the PS3, using both as a Blu Ray and DVD player and doing a lot of comparing, I have to say that it is very good if you fall into one of the following categories: 1. SONY Fanboy. If you are in this group you will think this system is the best due to the placebo effect and be very happy in your purchase no matter what. 2. Blu Ray user. If all you want to do is play Blu Rays this console has EXCELLENT Blu Ray playback, though the remote control is the worst home theater remote I have ever seen (button placement, readability, and responsiveness are terrible. 3. Filthy stinking rich. Back when this system came out a lot of people liked it simply for SONY bragging rights. They make ridiculous claims about superior image quality that they feel are justified because they paid more for the hardware (therefore it must be better). 4. Techie Super Nerd. If you are running Unix/Linux/some other OS, love rewiring your Home Theater (or perhaps your car?), fiddling with your BIOS, and setting things up MANUALLY this is the system for you. It has the most confusing settings menus I have ever seen in a piece of home electronics in my life.

As far as sound and graphics go, the Xbox and PS3 are about equal. They both output HDMI in HD both audibly and visually. While the PS3 can indeed output 1080p, this will not effect your experience unless you are using a screen larger than 50 inch and have Eagle Eyes. Even then, the increased resolution may actually WORSEN the picture (razer-sharp picture makes artifacting more obvious and display flaws stick out worse).

Mechanically the advantages of game-based and movie based experience on the Xbox and PS3 cancel each other out. While the PS3 requires no disc swapping due to disc space requirements, almost every game REQUIRES an install because of differences in rotation speed at the center and outside edge of Blu Ray discs. While Blu Rays look spectacular, DVDs look WORSE on the PS3 than on the Xbox due to inferior up-scaling (no arguments please, this is based off of repeated tests of identical scenes in DVDs).

The controller for the PS3 has no user-replaceable battery and this is a major disadvantage (I had to string a USB cable all the way from the system to my couch to keep playing when my controller ran out of juice, and the controller CANNOT be charged by plugging it into a USB-wall-charge adapter). The controllers are also more expensive than Xbox controllers. And of course, the Xbox controllers are concave instead of convex, and feature deep analog triggers. Personally I think that's just better design.

The online experience on the PS3 is a joke. Not only has the entire online store been down for over a month (a temporary glitch, but STILL) with people's personal info and credit card info compromised, the online store NEVER allowed me to download anything using a credit card. I tried every possible way to list my address and it STILL was rejected by SONY (not my credit card company's fault). After calling SONY's support all I was told was ""Keep trying"". UNACCEPTABLE. More than that, while Xbox Live has a trial version of EVERY game, hardly ANY of the downloadable games on PSN have a trial version! And when you DO download a trial...it HAS TO INSTALL!!!! What kind of a joke is this SONY???

Overall, the entire PS3 experience is just...clunky. After getting used to the smooth, easy, effortless Xbox Menu Navigation with its large readable icons and fonts, going over to the PS3 was a lot more work. There's a reason why the Xbox is more popular for online play despite having a price tag for Xbox Live. You get what you pay for.

I do own a few PS3 games, but I largely find myself not playing them as I use my Xbox 360 for playing all games that are available for both systems and playback of all my DVDs. The 360 also makes for a great Windows Media Player device, allowing you to control and record TV, and play back videos and music. And of course Xbox Live has some games for retro gamers (Ikaruga and Rez anyone? Am I the only one excited about Guardian Heroes and Radiant Silvergun on XBLA?) that are just not available on the PS3.

If you can only buy one system, buy an Xbox 360. If you are into retro gaming buy a Wii. If you want a Blu Ray Player and want to play PS3 exclusive games, or fit into one of the groups I mentioned (:I'm a super-techie gamer nerd :) go for it. Just make sure you explore your options and give it a test-drive first.

*Update November 18th, 2011*

I discovered a Playstation 2 Controller Adapter that allows you to play the Playstation 3 with a Dual Shock 2 Controller. While not perfect (no guide button or six-axis obviously, and no rumble function) it DOES effectively eliminate the horrible controller of the Playstation 3 from the equation, including the recharge and L2 and R2 buttons that are incredibly uncomfortable. For me this is almost a deal-breaker fix. I HIGHLY recommend you pick one of these up if you can do without rumble and don't mind cables. Just make sure to get a remote if you get rid of your six-axis controller so you can use the guide button. The only reason this does not raise the system to a five star product is that it is not provided by SONY, and there is no SONY wired controller option (another reason to buy an Xbox 360; if you want a wired controller you can get one instead of a wireless controller).

*Update June 11th, 2012*

After getting a brand new Dual Shock 3 I have found that the design of the control was VASTLY improved since the original Six-Axis controller. If you get a PS3, be sure you throw away the Six-Axis and get a Dual Shock 3 immediately for both vibration functionality and reduced hand-strain. There are still charge issues, but these can be dealt with by getting a REALLY long mini-USB cable to plugging the controller into your PC when you aren't playing (the controller doesn't seem to gradually decrease in power, it just sudden goes from full charge to nothing).

Since writing my original review I have discovered that the system is worth buying for the game Valkyria Chronicles alone, and have replaced the hard drive with a high-capaciy laptop hard drive. I then started to download some hard-to-find PS1 games that have become available on the PSN store and some truly brilliant PSN games (Flower and Journey).

Based upon various reviews and player feedback, I assumed that this game would be like 10 hours long, a bit buggy, and dumbed down. Fortunately, none of this was the case. I had some good fun with this over a weekend (yes, it can be finished over a weekend) and didn't come across a single bug. Fable is not in the same league as Morrowind, Oblivion, Gothic 2, or some of the other great roleplaying games (RPG) out there, but it does provide an enjoyable diversion.

Gameplay: The controls are the typical WASD keys and mouse commands found in most single-player RPGs. The game is fairly easy to learn and navigate. The story traces the hero from childhood through adulthood, when he'll have to, you know, save the world. There are no character classes per se, but you can roughly play as a warrior, magic-user, or stealth/archer character, or some mixture of these.  Much of the story centers around a main quest line, but there are a number of side quests available. Unlike most RPGs, quests are assigned by quest cards that you pick up at the Heroes Guild (lol! That's what it's actually called).  It's a rather artificial-feeling system, but it's functional.  Progression in the game is quite linear. In most instances, you will not be able to even leave the beaten patch, since fences, rocks, and invisible barriers won't allow it. Compared to more open-ended RPGs like the Elder Scrolls series, Fable seems restrictive and light weight in this regard. Overall, it's a decent story, but it is rather force-fed to you.

The game includes several interesting touches. People react to you based upon whether you've performed good or bad deeds. If you roleplay like a saint, you'll eventually have a halo and butterflies floating around. Ladies (and guys) will worship you, and you do have the option to buy a home and marry (multiple times if you'd like). If you play as an evil character, you'll eventually grow horns and fall out of favor with polite company. The nonplayer characters in the game, at least in the towns, have jobs and schedules. They work during the day and sleep at night, though only quest-related characters have anything to say of interest.

Although you can only play the game as the same guy, you can customize him with tattoos, facial hair, haircuts, and a (small) assortment of armor. You can control how your character's skills develop, but not as deeply as you can in a game like Morrowind or Baldur's Gate. There are other small things that you can do, such as fish, play games of chance, and treasure hunt. Overall, this game takes about 20-25 hours to do everything it has to offer, so it is rather short for an RPG.

The things that I didn't much care for are not major, but simply underscore the light-weight nature of this particular game. The game is certainly designed to appeal to the adolescent crowd, with hotkeys for burping, farting, and so forth. The various tattoo styles and haircuts further highlight this point. There is nothing really offensive in the game; it just feels a bit immature in places. Also, the save system is based mostly on the checkpoint model. You can't save just anywhere (at least your quest progress will not save), but the game will autosave at important junctures.

Graphics: The game looks quite good. Character models are convincing (though a bit cartoonish and often repeated), and the natural environment is screenshot beautiful in some places. Since the pathing is fairly restrictive, much of the scenary is noninteractive. It's not like Oblivion or Gothic 2, where if you can see it then you can probably travel to it.

Sounds: Voice acting is pretty good, with the usual British accents that invariably seem to accompany such games. The music is particularly well done and appropriate for the various atmospheres. Ambiant sounds are also decent.

Replayability/Technical Issues: The game is probably worth playing twice: once as a good guy and once as a bad guy. It will play similarly either way, but there are different ways to perform certain quests depending on your moral disposition. Technically, the game was perfectly stable on my computer--no freezes, crashes, or other problems. The manual is decent and explains much of the game, along with the in-game tutorial.

If you like RPG games and can get this one cheap, go for it. It's a well-polished, though simple, rump through a fairly well rendered world. Don't expect the same character depth, engrossing story, or exploring options that you'll find in some of the games that I mentioned above. However, Fable: The Lost Chapters is good for several hours of entertainment.",Surprisingly good,1163462400,47,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
4.0,False,"06 3, 2016",A57Q87B0TC9IJ,B01CDYB8AG,Derek G,"The Logitech G610 Mechanical Keyboard is solid, weighing in at over two and a half pounds.  Mine came with Cherry MX Red switches, not the Romer-G key switches you see in the more expensive Logitech models.  The cord is braided but it does not detach from the keyboard itself.  Compared to the previous keyboard I was using, I noticed the keys on the left, aka the Tab, Caps Lock, Shift, and Ctrl keys, are a little skinnier.  It will take a bit of adjustment.

A nice wave effect moving left to right appears when you first plug in the keyboard.  This will also happen every time you start your computer until it is recognized when you log in.  At this point, the keyboard will switch to your fixed brightness setting or your chosen effect.  Other effects include the famous ""breathing"" pattern where all keys slowly get brighter then dimmer, a ""starlight"" pattern where random keys light up and go dark as if stars were twinkling, a pattern where only the keys you touch light up, and another pattern where only the keys you set in advance stay lit.  Please note that there are no colors, just four degrees of bright white and lights off.  The brightness of the light can be configured manually by clicking the lightbulb button on the top-right side of the keyboard, or you can program the advanced features by downloading the Logitech Gaming Software from Logitech's site.

(Please excuse the descriptions, I tried to create a video of the effects, but the camera kept moving out of focus.)

I was surprised to find that I was only able to rebind the F1-F12 keys using the Logitech Gaming Software.  Every so often a game comes along with keys that are not rebindable and it would be nice to create custom keys.  For instance, older games used to use the arrow keys to move your character around and it would be nice to have rebound them to the new WASD standard.

Now to interject some personal opinion.  I don't like Cherry MX Red switches, simple as that.  The reds ""push back"" too much compared to membrane keyboards and the muscles in my fingers actually hurt after using this keyboard for a while.  I also wish I could program the multimedia keys (Play/Pause, Stop, Prev, Fwd) so they would work on website players and YouTube. Strangest of all, Logitech decided to put the Shift-keys on the bottom and the regular keys on top of the key caps.  It's the only keyboard I've seen that does this and it's unnerving, especially when dealing with punctuation.  Look at pictures of the keyboard and you'll see what I mean.

On the positive side, I do like the fat scroll wheel above the 10-key keypad which makes it easy to adjust the sound volume of your computer. The ""Mute"" button right next to the scroll wheel makes for quick defense against sudden loud volume.  The joystick button is a nice inclusion that keeps you from hitting the Windows key by mistake.  Unlike an old G105 keyboard, this keyboard remembers all of your different button settings after you shut down and restart your computer.

To summarize:

Pros -
- Solid construction with braided cable
- Actual Cherry MX key switches
- Nice wave effect every time you start your computer
- Adjustable illumination both on keyboard and Logitech Gaming Software
- Easy to reach multimedia keys with volume control and instant Mute
- Logitech Gaming Software is intuitive and easy to use
- Joystick button prevents the dreaded Windows key from getting in the way of your games

Negatives -
- Limited to white color only, no RGB like more expensive models
- Upside down keycaps - Shift keys are on bottom and regular keys are on top
- Only F1-F12 keys are rebindable.
- Cherry MX Red requires greater actuation force compared to membrane
- Multimedia keys are not rebindable

Most of the negatives are personal opinion.  In other words, perhaps you care more about price than RGB coloring and you may like Cherry MX Red (or Brown).  The futuristic font isn't bad but reversing the order of the Shift-keys is nonsense so I knocked off a star.  The Logitech Gaming Software is great, as always, and can pair up with your Logitech mouse as well.

Instead is a top down view of both the offense and defense players. It makes the players appear small but gives a better over view of the whole field. After the ball is snapped and the ball is handed off or passed to a receiver the camera begins to zoom in a bit. I guess one would call this a dynamic camera.  It really takes getting used to. But running plays are easier to run because the camera shows openings and holding the RT on your controller gives you a big speed burst. Another feature is that you have more time to check off your receivers to complete a pass. Past Madden games would have the QB sacked to quickly.
  Cons--- The kickoff is a horizontal view and I like the vertical view like past Madden games. Secondly, on defense I can find the 3-4 and nickel defensive packages but not the dime package for deep defensive sets? I found that odd

Despite being my first mechanical keyboard, I really wanted one with linear switches after typing on a coworker's and I also wanted one with RGB backlighting and one of good quality. I decided this looked like the best bang for the buck. It may be overkill for me since I use it at work as a software engineer rather than at home for gaming, but it feels really good to type on. I love the lack of resistance and I can tell it is made very well.

(See update regarding the following complaints.)

I only have two complaints. The wrist rest that came with it is terrible. It is way too low and I basically don't use it. The software also leaves a lot to be desired. The effects it offers are cool, but I wish it offered a little more customization. For instance, I'd love to combine the ""rainbow wave"" effect with the ""type lighting"" effect; what I picture is that when a key is pressed, it lights up white for a couple of seconds and gradually fades back to the rainbow effect. Unfortunately, the options per effect are fairly limited.

Although the software leaves something to be desired, that is not the primary reason I gave it four stars. The primary reason for giving it four stars is the wrist rest. I fee like they could include one that does not taper so much (to the point of being pointless to use) for the price.

Despite that, I love the keyboard and will be purchasing another one for my PC at home when I get a little extra cash to spend.

UPDATE: It turns out you can use more than one effect at the same time! I figured out how to have the white type lighting effect (on key press) on top of the always-on rainbow wave. It took some messing around with it to figure out it, though, and it only works with the effects in a certain order. So, while versatile, the software is still a little difficult to use.

I still don't feel like I am ""5 stars"" in love with it, but I stand by my final verdict: the keyboard is great and I will be purchasing another one.","Sturdy build, relaxing performance; lackluster software and wrist rest",1516579200,3,"{'Color:': ' RGB', 'Style:': ' Keyboard'}",

Due to this fact, I occasionally miss the feel of a controller in my hand when playing games on my PC.  For an average thumb jockey like myself, I have no clue how keyboard ninjas manage to hit countless hotkeys with so much precision.  I am overjoyed to have a joystick like this come along and be available to use on complicated flight sim games or fighting games.  Below I will give you the highlights and lowlights of this joystick...

(To skip to the main points, simply read the headers of each section.)

THE GOODS:

Quick and Nimble Response Time-
This pro is a biggie for me.  Joysticks I've used in the past had some annoying lag problems and caused me to crash and burn.  This particular one responds so well to every button press, quicker than even my PS3 controller in fact!  The only drawback though is that buttons beside the trigger button have a tad too much firmness to them.  Which means I have to put a bit of force in my button pushes to get the desired results.

Excellent Control and Precision-
While this is not a crucial criteria for games that merely require you to walk your character forward, this is absolutely critical for flight sim games.  A stiff joystick delivers terrible result in such games and can truly make the experience less enjoyable.  This particular one gives you an incredible amount of control and allows you to gauge your movements with precision.  It rotates with very little resistance and feels incredibly natural.

Comfortable Grip-
I love how the joystick just fits in the hand so perfectly, almost like a glove.  Despite the smooth texture, its far from slippery and I can maintain a grasp of it for hours.  The two things I dislike however, are the stiff trigger with uncomfortable ridges (will go into that later) and the far too low hand rest.  I have smaller hands, so if I lay my hand on the rest, my index finger only reaches the bottom of the trigger.  Those with larger hands may not experience this issue but its still a big enough annoyance for me to complain about.  Regardless of these flaws, using this joystick still feels like an effortless experience.

Sturdy Base-
The base on this device is just brilliant.  It doesn't add a ton of weight to the apparatus so you can easily pick up and reset the joystick.  It has performed so well that I only had a couple near topple occurrences.  Usually such instances happen when I'm doing an emergency nose dive and have no choice but to act fast.  In such cases, I only had the base lift an inch or so off my desk.

THE BADS:

Big Footprint-
Unfortunately the price to pay for a sturdy base is the big footprint this joystick leaves.  You have to clear just enough room for it to fit amongst all the other paraphernalia on your desk.  This isn't that much of a negative however, this joystick may be a bit too bulky for gamers with modest desk space.

Right Hand Only-
Left handed gamers will find this joystick to be utterly unusable.  Not only is the hand rest curvature sitting on the right side but all the programmable buttons are placed on the left side.  Meaning that a left handed gamer cannot lay their hand on the rest and they will have to uncomfortably reach over the stick to use any of the buttons.  This may seem like a small flaw but in reality is quite fatal as it limits those who can purchase this joystick.

Stiff Trigger-
I would appreciate if the trigger on the joystick was not so stiff.  I believe a trigger that could be depressed more would cause less pressure on my index finger.  I also dislike the ridges placed on the trigger.  I understand they are included to prevent slipping off the button, but perhaps a texturized trigger could have solved this problem better.

All in all, this is a great joystick for average or expert thumb jocks alike.  Despite its quirks, it  preforms incredibly well and can stand up to a good deal of abuse.  I would definitely say this joystick is still a contender against the latest joysticks on the market.",Sleek and Smooth Control,1283644800,,,

I also love that you can shoot various body parts that cause the enemies to react convincingly (like shooting a running zombie in the leg causing them to trip and fall).

The controls are outdated and awkward though. Turning around takes forever (though there is a quick 180 degree turn around feature) and there is no dodge button (except in boss fights).

The graphics are very nice, as well as the music and can be controlled/played using both the stylus and the DS's controls (Thank you Konami).

There are 26 mysteries to solve, one for each week of the year, while in the process of becoming the greatest wizard of them all. While learning spells and incantations like Harry Potter you can do a wide range of things thus the similarity to the Animal Crossing series.
These range from decorating your dorm room with new furniture, learning and buying songs that you can perform in an instrument or whistle them, buying new clothes that includes many kinds shoes and pants and skirts, not just tops and hats., fishing, catching bugs, diging for gems and rare items.
The game is played in real time, and it will adjust itself to the clock and calendar settings of your DS. It has wifi capabilities you can have up to 3 players visit your school, and you can perform music together if you have isntruments like a mini chamber music quartet. Konami also has a few free items the player can download from time to time., so far magic brooms you can ride.
Like in AC for the DS up to 4 players can play with a single game cartridge and have their own separate rooms at the dorm.

Yes, the Playstation version has loading times, but they're not THAT big of a deal.  They're extremely short and hardly an inconvenience.  Also, the rooms were more colorful and it was easier to see what was in front of you in the Playstation version.

The PC version misses out on those things, but it does make up for that by having better animations from enemies and bosses.  But the controls aren't as good as the Playstation controller either (sorry, I need a controller for a video game console because that's what I've grown up with).

The game features an excellent storyline with the top notch acting we have come to expect. The characters are all deep and well written. If you enjoy spending hours listening to dialogue and immerse background you'll be right at home. It's one of the best story lines in recent games. Unfortunately the game play and graphics are not up to par. The environments and cut scenes are not very polished. The character models look good but beyond that the graphics fall short. The combat gameplay is this games true shortcoming. The games nearly impossible on higher difficulties and barely beatable on normal. The reason for this is that in many areas you are swarmed with enemies. The tactics and way the skills are set up don't seem to work very well. Eventually you will get a grasp on it but the system isn't real good. My biggest complaint is that you cant create a tactic to revive characters on the console so you will need to micromanage your team a lot. The game allows for friendly fire and the way enemies swarm you in most areas it renders most of your mages spells to uselessness. Many spells require a cool down time and many times within seconds your team can be wiped out. Healing items are also scarce at merchants so this may make many players play on the easy setting which is no challenge at all. The story and sidequests and character background are the reason to play the game There are multiple beginnings endings and choices to be made. You can even have some PG romance along the way. If your not careful you can lose party members based on choices you make.

I never realized how hard it is to sing an entire song, let alone many songs in a row.  The first thing that improved was my breathing, and I can now sing for a longer time without gasping for air or straining my vocal chords.  My singing has gone from average to respectable, and it's all from playing this game.  I admit, I don't like to play this game with others as much as I like playing it alone, as it gives me more time to practice my singing.  At first I only sang the songs I was familiar with, and stuck to artists whose vocal ranges more closely matched my own.  As I got better, I found I was able to sing songs I could never sing before.  I'm currently working on being able to sing like Aretha.  I have gotten confident enough to start learning the songs I didn't know before, and I have a better appreciation for both music and singing.
As a game, KR has been a hit with everyone I have coaxed into playing.  Players can have different judging levels to compensate for their level of ability.  The easy level is good at first, but the key is to move up to more difficult judging levels so you can really work on improving your singing.

I have updated my review from 2 stars to 4 stars.  This is because Turn 10 has actively listened and responded to fan feedback, and has made changes.

These changes include:
- Adjusted career winnings.
- Reduced car prices.
- Increased ""Forza Rewards"" money.
- Road America track download for FREE.
- Long Beach Circuit track download for FREE.

As a result of these changes, the game required much less grinding to build up your garage.  Buying tokens now feels like an optional shortcut instead of a necessity.  It feels less like the ""free-to-play"" business model that it did before.

I'd like to give the game a 5 star rating, but the microtransaction monetization scheme is still present... even if it much less obnoxious now.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Turn 10 and Microsoft are charging $60 - $80 for Forza 5, depending on the version you get.  However, despite the full price tag, they are treating this like a ""free-to-play"" game.  As it aggressively pushes for microtransactions.

You might hear a lot of players say ""Oh, you don't need to buy tokens!""  And they're right, you don't NEED to, but the game has been designed from the ground up to milk extra cash out of you.

Proof:
-  The storefront is gone
-  The auction house is gone
-  Gifting cars to your friends is gone
-  Sharing your cars in a Club is gone
-  Earning cars as level rewards is gone
-  Affinity bonuses don't get you free parts anymore
-  You can't sell cars back for money anymore
-  You can't sell parts back for money anymore

The end result of these changes is this:
Getting new cars is a LOT more time consuming.  Earning enough money to buy and upgrade multiple exotic cars requires excessive grinding... or buying tokens of course.

Forza 5 throws out so many of the things that made previous Forza titles great so that they can milk their loyal customers as much as possible.  It's like a slap in the face to someone like me, who has been loyal to the franchise for eight whole years.

Skip this entry.  With any luck Forza 6 will avoid these downfalls.",Microtransactions... sigh,1385510400,12,{'Format:': ' Electronics'},

It's very hard to find this game nowadays, but it is worth playing.

But this game fails to live up to its potential.  Arcanum is fun, but it's disappointing in some areas too.
The highlight of this game is its innovative skill point system for character development and enhancement.  It is kind of overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it, you will really like it.  Your character can spend skill points in a ton of different attributes and abilities.  They basically center around basic world skills like haggling and lockpicking, technology skills (which allow you to build weapons and potions from junk), and magic (i.e. casting spells).
The technology skills are especially interesting.  You buy a gallon of fuel, find a rag in the garbage can, and if you have the expertise, you combine it into a Molotov cocktail.  Or, you find a couple of roots and make them into a healing potion.  With the technology skills, you are basically finding or buying low value items, and making them into high value items.  The items that you can build increase in usefulness as you allot skill points to them.  So, at the beginning of the game, you can only refine ore, but later on you might be able to build a fancy set of plate mail.
I was very happy with the nonlinear plot line, and the huge world with its numerous sidequests.  This game rivals Baldurs Gate in those fashions.  I also enjoyed the music.  It is perfect at setting the 19th Century role-playing scene.
But, I found a few things to be very disappointing about this game:
1.  The cosmetic aspects of the game, like graphics, animation, and sound effects, are very mediocre.  This game underacheives badly for one that is so young.  Normally, I don't care all that much, but it this case, it really detracts from the game.  The detail level of the characters and scenery is minimal.  Every building in almost every city look largely the same.  Cinematic cutscenes are nonexistent.  Somewhat dated games like Baldurs Gate and Planescape:Torment still have much better cosmetics.  If you didn't know better, then you would think that Arcanum was released five years ago.
2.  ...  This is especially annoying for this game, because utilization of junk like metal springs and tobacco leaves plays such an integral part, so you have to carry tons of stuff with you.  Even simple tasks like switching weapons with one of your followers are tedious if your inventory is getting full.
3.  You can't control the actions of your followers, nor can you control how they develop.  This was the biggest disappointment to me.  Half of the game's strategy goes out the window here.  You can't build up one guy to be a thief type character, and build up another guy to be a battle tank.  Even if you could, your followers just rush head on into melee at the beginning of every battle, so clever tactics go out the window too.  This means that ranged weapons, like bows and guns, are hardly useful.  Pretty much ever battle ends up as a melee hack-and-slash fest.  After a while, the battles in this game get very repetitive.
I hope that Sierra makes another Arcanum, with some of these issues addressed.  It is a creative game.  It just has a few things to work on.","So much potential, so many flaws...",1010361600,,,

Single player was fun and you have the ability to choose which character you want to play as.  I still beleive the game should have co-op since there are two brothers to choose from with the exception of the first mission.  You can play as either of the two brother and you have the little brother that follows along.  You are on a quest to mexico looking for gold to fix the house that was left behind.  Not to mention you were fighting for the confederates but went desserter so you have these guys chassing you and trying to kill you and on your path to mexico you kill other guys.  On your hunt to mexico you will find vendors selling ammo and weapons in which you can upgrade your pistols, shotguns and rifles.  Not that much of a selections since it was all revolvers and rifles in the western days so don't expect anything special.

Online is good and their is a good selection of characters.  The character you choose is the weapon he will carry.  You start with about 2 guys and depending on how good you did after a ranked match, you will earn money so you can unlock more charaters.  During the game after you collected a certain amount of money, you can upgrade your chracter to have better helth or run faster.  At the end, any chracter that you upgraded, will loose it.

Without giving away spoilers I will discuss some pros and cons of the game and explain why ultimately I am giving it the WEAKEST of 4 stars.

Pros
- Rocksteady did their homework. Riddler challenges that rely on a lot of Bat History is a cool plus for a die hard Batman fan like myself. However this can be challenging and or frustrating for fans who only are casual Batman fans.

- Terrific voice acting. Batman sounds the same as he does back when Conroy was still doing BTAS, Scarecrow sounds creepy and menacing, and Troy Baker. I don't even need to explain anything there. However my one complaint was Gordon. Although I do love Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, I felt Gordon's voice did not match the character but that may just be my personal preference.

- The Villians. Another surprise was the use of not only well established villains but more recent and comic book entries. Apart from the typical two-face and penguin we are also treated to some surprise villains during the ""Gothams Most Wanted"" missions which I love how Rocksteady interpreted them into the Arkham Universe.

Cons

Annoying Riddler Challanges- It was the final game. I didn't want to just see the secret ending on YouTube, I wanted to earn it. I was wrong.... For all the trouble I went through the ending was just not that special to justify the frustration I went through. At the end of it all I was hoping Batman would break his rule and Kill Riddler, kidding (sorta...). Which brings me again to The Riddler...

-Riddler Batmobile races. Like I said before I wanted to personally murder the Riddler when the game was completed and his Challanges involving you racing against the clock only furthered that anger. I was lucky I managed to complete even the hardest of the races after a few tries but there are people on YouTube still stuck trying to beat certain Riddler races.

- Arkham Knight. I promised there would be no spoilers and I intend to keep my word. However with that being said, the reveal of Arkham Knight is not only anti climatic but underwhelming. I understood why they chose who they did and honestly I don't think I could have picked someone better, but still. It's resolution is clunky and quick.

Mixed bag

The God Damn Batmobile (Points if you get the reference) - Ok so at first I hated it. Clunky hard to drive, hard to turn, just not the best driving experience. I admit I got used to it and did enjoy it later on in the game. But I prefer soaring over Gotham, and grappling up buildings. Being forced to do so many Challanges with the car was not only annoying but could be frustrating when just starting out

Remember everything from the previous games? Well you better hope so because Rocksteady decided to just give you all your cool toys at the beginning of the game and hope you remembered how to use them. I discussed this with a friend who also agreed this tactic makes the game feel slightly rushed. I enjoyed the previous iterations where Batman had to get each weapon over time, instead the game is more focused on Batmobile upgrades.

So there you have it the pros and the cons, while its a good game it's not the best in the series. Personally it would be City, Asylum, then Knight for me. The game reminded me a lot of Dark Knight Rises which isn't the best thing in the world but still a fun time

There is enjoyment to be had but just don't expect this to be the best game in the series. Also on a side note. Although I compared this to ""Dark Knight Rises"" did anyone else pick up that Scarecrows plot is essentially the same exact one from ""Batman Begins""? Fear toxin all over Gotham etc

When I opened the box there was a warning stating that the game was realistically violent and it is intended for mature gamers; that's an understatement.  This game is freaking violent and bloody.

The story is very simple and there aren't any twists or turns making the story quite boring, but it moves the game along, so I'm not complaining.

The Gamecube used to have the Wrestlemania franchise on it, but the franchise was moved to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Box/dp/B0001B15RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Box</a>. This was the first game in a new series for the Gamecube. The game quickly caught on and became a huge success with wrestling fans. I was one of the people who loved this game. Often times I would have four friends come over just to enjoy the multiplayer madness. The only things I can say was wrong with this game is that the Story Mode is the same every time you play through it. It really hurts the replayabilty of this title.

Graphics- 7/10
The graphics in this game are top notch. The moves in the game are all very well animated. The arenas and crowd are fairly well done. Most of what you see is really good. The problem is that there isn't much of anything to look at. The game lacks in arenas and backstage areas in general. Still, what you see is nice.

Another problem is that the wrestlers don't exactly look perfect. Most of them are too glossy and have abnormal muscles. Even Andre the Giant has abs. Most wrestlers seem to be a bit overly muscular. The characters aren't all that bad, but there are things to nit pick at.

Story- 7/10
This game has a story mode much like all previous WWE games. The story mode can only be played as a created wrestler though. So for all you people hoping to live out your WWE career as Triple H, too bad. The storyline however is a good one. You build a created character and you start at a WWE Developmental Territory. Jonathan Coachman will teach you're the ropes. You will mostly fight other developmental talent like yourself. Once you have proved yourself, you will move onto Sunday Night Heat. Once you have finished Heat, you will move into the big leagues of either Raw or Smackdown. You surprising will take major interest from factions on the brands at the time and quickly become a top talent.

I actually truly enjoyed this storyline. There is one huge problem though; it's the same story every time you play. Sure, there are a few minor tweaks that will slightly adjust how you play, but it is still mostly the same game. It doesn't even matter which brand you pick. The storylines are the same, just with different wrestlers. Playing through the game once or maybe even twice will have satisfied any craving for this story mode.

Sound- 8/10
The game's soundtrack is made up of licensed music. You will hear it in matches and in menu screens. I will say that the music is a good selection though and matches what is going on during gameplay. There are actually only about 7-8 songs, but the never really lose their touch.

There is no voiceover or commentary in the entire game. You will be forced to read texts. However, considering how well the voiceover worked in future titles, I will say that this is a good thing. The only thing you will hear during your matches in music and your opponent slamming you into the mat.

Gameplay- 9.5/10
This is where the game makes a serious impression. The gameplay mechanics are near perfect. You can break up pin falls, submissions, and any other move. This is very realistic. If you do a move of the top rope and hit other people in the progress, they will be hurt as well. There are a vast amount of moves available in the game, including some that were not in previous titles. There are also tons of match types to choose from. There are cage matches, hell in a cell matches, ladder matches, and tons of other goodies including the new Bra and Panties match. The only match that is missing is the ominous Elimination Chamber match. That is due to the fact that there can only be four people in the ring at once.

Multiplayer is probably the most fun you'll ever have in a game. The game is set up so that anyone can win at a moments notice. I suggest buying a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/few-controllers/dp/B0002Y5180/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">few controllers</a>&nbsp;and having many fatal four way matches. Considering the fact the reversing is so easy and that moves can be broken up, every one has a chance at winning.

Create a Wrestler is decent in this game. You cannot make the most detailed character in the world, but it is fairly easy to use. You can even choose your reversal style, which is new to wrestling games. There is also a new Create an Entrance feature that allows you to create detailed entrances. This allows you to create nearly the perfect created wrestler.

The roster in Day of Reckoning is very small. You will get all your top stars like Triple H, The Rock, and Undertaker; you will also get a few Legends like Andre the Giant. However this game lacks bringing us a great undercard of talent. You get the around 7-8 lower card talents and that is all. Not to mention the fact that they left out Mick Foley, who had more influence on television than The Rock.

There are also unlockables in this title. You can buy weapons to appear under the ring, character creation parts, and many other things. This is one of the few reasons to actually play through the story mode more than once.

Difficulty- 8/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)
The game has a great difficulty level. Most anyone can pick it up and have a fair chance of winning. My girlfriend picked it up and played it just fine, and she is not even much of a gamer. One problem exists in the fact that Multi-Man Cage matches and Ladder Matches are insanely hard in this game. You will often find yourself losing the match over and over again.

Another problem is in story mode. If you lose a match, you will have to replay the match. You will repeat this process until you win. This is annoying especially when trying to win a multi-man Cage or Ladder match.

Overall- 8.5/10
This was not the perfect game, but it was one of my favorite wrestling video games. I think only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-SmackDown-Here-Comes-the-Pain/dp/B0000AHOOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE SmackDown!

EA Sports did an awesome job when they released Madden 05 and its ""Collector's Edition.""  They did an awesome job adding the interviews and showing the progression all the way from the beginning of Madden to the then current generation and even including THREE different versions of Madden.  Since then, I've been duped into buying the 07 collector's edition and this one.  The ""extra"" disc is okay, but it doesn't warrant really being called an ""extra"" disc.  I will review Head Coach 09 right now before I review Madden.  :YAWN!!!  I tried to play, and even made it through one game.  Yawn.  Anyway.  On to the game..

CONS:
1.  Way too much information on the screen prior to the snap.  After a few games, I've gotten the preplay options down fairly well.  I do hit the right stick, but it still does pop up every so often during the game.

2.  While I do appreciate the attempt at commentary upgrade from prior versions, Cris Collinsworth is rather dull, and the next time i have to hear him say, ""The joy about the NFL is watching qbs throw the ball, and WRs catching the ball.""  My, how insightful.  Worse yet, ""the tight end is like a pacifier."" comment.  enough!!!  I feel at times that eugene levy is doing the play by play
2a.  if Tom Hammond mentions one more frickin' time that today's game is brought to me by EA Sports, i will Elvis my TV and shoot it.
3.  Bring Madden back into his own game.
4.  bring back the all the officials, not just the referee, and the chain gang.
5.  when i challenge a play, let me know what I'm challenging first.  I hate challenging a catch on the sidelines, b/c the guy looked like he was out of bounds, but when I challenge, it challenges the spot of the ball.
6.  every so often, Cris will go to show me a backtrack, the logo will come up, and w/o pressing anything, it will disappear and go back to normal gameplay w/o doing squat.
7.  the td celebrations are a nice touch, but only make them available only after a cool TD like an INT ran back, or a kickoff, not when I QB sneak from a yard out with the game already in the bag.

PROS:
1.  gameplay and graphics are awesome.
2.  they brought back the option to allow the cpu to play itself if you are bored and just want to watch.
3.  the ability to bluff your plays.  when i play humans, the main one i play against tends to watch my play.
4.  If I lose a challenge, the salt isn't rubbed into the wound anymore by showing me the scoreboard graphic of ""TIME OUT.""  It's a little subtler now.

It took a little bit for this game to grow on me for some reason.  I do at least enjoy playing the 93 version.  I must be dumb b/c i don't know where all these extra plays are supposed to be.  This is probably a partial wish list for next year, but at least attach the field goal nets to something instead of casper the friendly ghost raising them.  bring back the chain gang, and the ability to truly squib quick.  it would also be nice if they would put up a sports ticker at the bottom like on the ps1 with ongoing scores of the other games going on when you are playing on the ea sports ticker.  It's too bad that they can't throw in real time scores as well.
overall, the game is an improvement over the past two incarnations of madden for the xbox 360, but it really didn't live up to the hype that this game was getting.  the box mentions 85 new features, but i've yet to find 20.

-colorful, super sharp and detailed graphics, enemies are well rendered, backgrounds are so magnificent I really would like to visit the places that were shown in the game (even if I know they don't exist)
-great frame rate
-excelent multiplayer with possible cooperative mode

This is not a strategy game. If you asked me I would have no idea what the game was about except for some time travel and quest for a holy grail. The point of the game is to keep you finger on the trigger until all the enemies are dead. I know it may sound dull and boring but believe me it's not. It's a combinations of curiosity of what's next, great music, graphics and high paced action that keeps you glued to yoru console. There is no boring down times looking for clues. You pick and item and get 50 enemies showing up at once. You are done with that another 50 comes running. This game is fun. How do I know it?

The Bad: Generally the same, woeful graphics, loading......

I heard all the hoopla about Persona 3, but the next gen craze side tracked me from it. I finally rented the game and I have to say I am very impressed. I'm tired of the same old random battle JRPG with clich stories, characters and battle systems. P3 tries to do something different with practically every element. When you start the game out you'll notice the game has beautifully drawn anime cut scenes. The story doesn't become very clear until after you start playing, but this is OK.

The first thing I have to say is that the game takes FOREVER to get going. Maybe 5-6 hours into the game you'll really start getting interesting and most of the play mechanics and taught. When you're not fighting you'll be living your regular school life by studying hard and preparing for exams. The game has a calendar event setup and you go to school, talk to some people, you can choose to stay awake in class and listen to the lecture to increase your academic skills. Sometimes you'll have to answer questions (it's mostly guessing) and maybe your charm will increase. After school you can meet up your friends to strengthen your Social Link (more on that later). Depending on the responses you choose will affect your relationships. You can also go around shopping at the mall for items, weapons, armor etc. Another thing I have to mention is there isn't enough to buy before the next moon phase (more on that later). So you there is one new thing for each member and that's it. This can make traveling the upper levels of Tarturus even harder (more on that later).

The game's story is about Shadows that try to wreak havoc during the Dark Hour which is midnight. During this hour the Dorm you stay at turns into a mysterious tower known as Tarturus and you must climb the tower fighting stronger and stronger enemies. Every 30 days you fight a boss and some event happens that evolves the story. During those 30 days you have to increase your Social Links, level up, and acquire all that you can before the big boss. When you fight in battle you use your Personas which are like Aeons (think Final Fantasy) and they are your strongest attacks. You'll rarely attack yourself so you always concentrate on your Personas. Some Personas have different magic abilities etc. The battles are won by determining the enemy's weakness and exploiting this. When you hit their weakness you get one more turn and that enemies falls down. If you get all the enemies to fall down you can do an all out attack where all the players will maul the enemies for extra damage. This is key to mastering because you can die very easy early in the game because leveling up takes longer that it should. Luckily you can switch Personas in mid battle so you can exploit accordingly.

One irritating thing about this game is they changed the elements' names. Instead of Fire, Ice, Wind, Fire it's Zio, Bufu, Garu (light) and it's really stupid. Why did they do this? Probably just to be cute, but it confuses you and you have know idea what these names mean. Once you win a battle you may get a Shuffle Time which lets you see faces of a card and it shuffles them around. Some may give you bonus experience, some may be new Persona, some may be weapons. While you run around through Tarturus you can see the Shadows so this game isn't random. If you hit them first you get an advantage, but let them hit you and it's not so good.

The game mainly evolves around Persona so, of course, you can make your own. Take your cards to the Velvet Room and you can combine them to make better Personas. Now there are attributes and rules, but these are confusing and pointless so you just add a few up and see what it makes. It's really simple and easy to use, but you can't do this for a while because you can only create Persona that are at your level. Also in the VR you can take requests from Elizabeth by bringing her certain items at certain dates for rewards. I found this very hard because you never really know what she's talking about half the time. I think it's mainly there for completionists.

Social Links effect your Persona because if you have a friend that is a Magician SL all your Magician Persona will level up faster. Of course there are events every day that always change. Sometimes you can't go to Tarturus at night because your members are too tired, some may get sick, some may be busy studying for exams etc. This changes things up all the time so not one day is the same. When it all boils down is that the game is generally always the same. Go to school, go to Tarturus over and over. There are no worlds or levels to actually explore so this may disappoint some people. When in doubt pick up Persona 3 because you are going to have a blast and there are dozens of hours of RPG goodness here.

As I'm sure you're already aware, there is no season or dynasty gameplay option in MM 2002.  While this GREATLY detracts from the single player experience, the game's gameplay itself is GREATLY improved over the Live series.  Let's start with the rebounding.  On Live 2001 and 2002, you more often than not chase down loose balls as rebounds.  Rarely will you see a player actually jump and catch a ball off the rim.  This is not the case in MM 2002.  If you're on offense, you'd better put up a decent shot, because there aren't many offensive rebounds.  No more putting up 3 after 3 because the defense can't get a board.  No more throwing passes into a clogged lane.  If you do this, it'll likely get stolen.  The momentum meter, while usually limited to the college game, adds a measure of realism to the games.  I mean, let's face it...when a team is on a roll, they shoot better as a team.  In Live, this isn't the case.  Now you people can cry about the dynasty and season modes being omitted, but if you'd have done 10 minutes worth of research, you'd have saved 50 bucks, so quite your crying.

If you liked Black Flag then it's more of that awesomeness, although I rushed through most of this game after spending 60 hours getting 100% on Black Flag.

The PC version may be more suitable to picky people as the lack of anti-aliasing and the lower-than-optimal frame rate were in stark contrast to the smooth looking and playing game of Black Flag, but that's to be expected of all console versions. Being the first Assassin's Creed I've played on consoles I'm amazed how much better the controls are on a controller, meaning I might have to never play with a keyboard and mouse again when it comes to these games. I also had a weird issue during the cutscenes where the voices would skip and then immediately become (ironically) unsynced with the lips, making for some painful experiences but that was solved after I installed the game to my 360's hard drive. I also don't appreciate the amount of loading screens: sail too fast on ocean, load screen; open a menu, load screen; open a shop, load screen; crafting menu, load screen; finishing a mission, 5 seconds of waiting as the menu loads; try to travel too quickly, tons of little load screens. It adds up and becomes rather annoying.

Contrary to some reviews I've read here, there are a few tailing missions, though it's not nearly as plentiful as previous Assassin's Creeds and the missions are fun otherwise, with a pretty interesting story for anyone interested in playing each and every game.

I HATED this game, HATE HATE HATED it - briefly.
When I first started it up, I loved it, it was fun, funny, had tongue in cheek jokes all over the place.
But then it became really really hard, tedious, you cannot save in the middle of a level so you have to play the damned level again and again and again.
What's more, it is buggy and crashes - even with the patch, it is still a bit buggy (Jan 2000) - so you start the level again.
What I did not realise is that this is NOT a shoot 'em like Unreal Tournament or Quake 3, for example when you are a Mech you send your team in to do the fighting for you.
When I learnt that (from the strategy guide) I realised how much more fun it was.
However it does tend to get tedious.
Overall, a fresh new concept with lots of promise, but the developers are not experienced enough to have made something stable, with ongoing excitement.

4.0,False,"03 17, 2014",A5Y7WUBMHBT8I,B00F6YD2FK,Peter Malek,"So I have clocked in over 300 hours on Demon Souls, and over 500 hours on Dark Souls 1, and would easily give both previous games 5's. So I am a huge fan of the series, I have played Dark Souls 2 for about 25 hours, and taken down enough bosses to know what the game is about. I personally can say that some people are going to find that this game is honestly the best in the series for them, it adds tons of new concepts that are really great, and this is the hugest world to date, which is amazing. The animations are a bit more fluid, which is cool, and they kept a lot of the old weapons from the series, as well as adding new ones, so for players like me who are set in their ways of grabbing certain weapons first in Dark Souls 1, it's great to be able to get your bearings and know which weapons are crap and whats good for your play style, as well as some interesting surprises in weapons (there are 2 NPC's I've come across so far who take boss souls and turn them into weapons).

Now to the reason I am giving this game a 4 out of 5. In all honesty, I have already stated that the game is great, but it's just not a great game for me. While some of the changes to the series are good for the series, and I can understand why the majority of people would like them, they just aren't good for me as an individual. So I know for a fact that I will not be breaking the 100 hour mark on this game, since I am already getting kind of sick of it, and I've only played for 25 hours. I guess for me as an individual there is something about this game that's missing the same flare I really enjoyed about the previous 2 games. I played Dark Souls 1 from the time it was released all the way to a week before Dark Souls 2 was released, so I do not have a misunderstanding of how the series is. I just simply can't place my finger on what I dislike on the whole. So I'll try and explain some dislikes.

First big thing - I have these 2 rings called Ring of Life Protection. You repair them for 3k souls, and what they do is if you die with one equipped you don't lose anything. The problem? In the previous game if you died with one of these types of rings equipped you'd lose the ring. So at this point with 2 of these rings, I never run the risk of losing anything. Should I just run without the rings if it bothers me? No, I'm not an idiot so why would I do that? ;P Just was more fun when you had a true sense of loss if you weren't super careful, kept you far more on your toes. If I die now, who cares? Not like I'm losing sleep over it, and with the addition of being able to equip 4 rings instead of 2 now, you can afford to keep 1 of these rings on full time.

Second annoying thing - weapon durability has been cut dramatically, and weapons can now only be repaired (if broken) at Blacksmith's. So you really need to upgrade at LEAST 2 weapons simultaneously if you plan on playing a melee (I cannot speak for casters since I made a Warrior), I personally have 3 weapons just in case. The problem with this is that resources are scarce, and if you upgrade the wrong weapon, your stuck running with a low durability weapon for an eternity, not because you want to, but because it's your most powerful weapon (I upgraded a weapon that had low durability BEFORE I discovered how much a problem durability can be in this game, which was never the case in both previous games). Again this wouldn't be as big an issue if A: you could purchase as many Repair Powders as you wish (the Blacksmith in Majura only sells you 1) or B: they allow you to repair your own weapons at the bonfire. This also plays into the whole lack of enjoyment of exploring the levels, since your durability can be so problematic that you'll sometimes be running back to a Bonfire just so your weapons don't break.

The last thing really isn't so much a knock at the game, but more of a personal issue. I am just not a fan of the Rat Covenant, I tried exploring the Dwarf zone (it's called Gyrm's Respite) and I keep getting sucked into another players world. The problem? When your dealing with people in the Rat Covenant, they suck you into THEIR game, and I've noticed a lot of people will try and set traps for you, and just wait at the end, leaving you to have to clear out a bunch of THEIR mobs, just to get to them, and it got so bad that if I go into the 2 areas that you get summoned by the Rat Covenant, I usually just turn my PS3 to offline mode just to clear the zones, since you keep getting summoned every few minutes, and nothing is more annoying then having to clear trash just to get to some idiot who is wasting your time, and you can't exit his world until either you kill him or he kills you. This is really stupid in my opinion, because it forces you into the aggressor role, and they can just hang back and waste your time by staying very far in. This has been the case for me every time, I'm not saying EVERYONE plays like this, however the 8 times I've been summoned into another players game world, this is what I encountered. Since 8 times isn't enough to form an opinion on the entire population, I can't knock a point off for the Rat Covenant, but I can add it to the list of many reasons why I didn't like the experience.

All in all, I can't give a game made by this team anything less then a 4, but I will no longer be continuing with the series either. I hope my review has been helpful, I honestly think a lot of people will truly love this game, since you call tell they put a LOT of work into it, I just can honestly say it's not for me.",You'll either love the changes or hate them,1395014400,3,"{'Edition:': "" Collector's"", 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

4.0,True,"09 29, 2014",AFJAC5NZ8R5VS,B00K2O4O6K,Adam Anime,"There have been 5 entries in the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm series and I own (and have played through) all of them so far..Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution is the latest entry and the second non-cannon game( the other being Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations). As this is a side game, it doesn't advance the story that ended in a sort of cliff hanger in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. Instead it's a filler game that's job is to tie fans over till  Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (which will most likely be the final entry since the manga is ending soon and so is the anime). Question is.... does it it do this job well? well here's my review of the game...

First the graphics: What can i say about the graphics?.. the cell shaded visuals are just as amazing as any of the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm games and the anime cut scenes look really great as well. If you've played Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 full burst, then you know what to expect graphically since it really can't( and doesn't need to) get any better then it is now.

The Characters: This game ( much like the other entries in the series) is a primarily a arena style 3D fighting game. You fight opponents in 3 dimensions as you run, dash and jump around large fighting arena areas. The normal fighting seen in the other Ninja Storm games is the same here.. just with a few new additions to the combat.. First is the ability to counter your enemy's attack.. in on of two ways.. either by using a guard-break item from your items you can use with the D-pad or by hitting the shoulder button you use for blocking at the same time you hit the attack button.. the second method is different in the sense that it will take a bit of your chakra, block that part of your chakra gauge from recovering all the way temporarily and is only effective when you time it right with your opponent attacks you. Either way, it freezes up your opponent and allows you to counter attack against them and is a welcome addition.

Beside the guard breaking technique you can also now perform a true team ultimate Jutsu with certain characters and team mates. When selecting characters to use to fight, you can select temamates and some pairs will allow for alternate Ultimate Jutsu attacks that have them combining their powers together. if you played the demo of the game then you already knoe about this,if you don't a few examples of the team ultimate jutsu pairs include Tailed Beast mode Naruto with Sasuke and Sakura, Kakashi with Might Guy and  Tailed Beast mode Naruto with Hinata.. The team ultimate Jutsu attacks are rally fun to do and really fun to see in action... I wish there were more, but maybe they'll add more as DLC or something..

Oh and now you  separately select if you wanna use ultimate jutsu, 2 forms of awakening mode or  the new Drive mode after you select your character(s). the first two are pretty much self-explanatory...as for the 3rd, the new Drive mode lets your teammates support you faster and in new ways and alas lets you use a sealing barrier jutsu that temporarily seals away your opponent's chakra, substitution ability, support from teammates  are generally  give you the opportunity to really kick your opponent's butt big time.

Other then that, the fighting is unchanged from previous installments .. except you can dash around even when blocking, but since you can't block attacks while doing this it isn't always worth it. Oh and of course I should mention that their are around 118 playable characters.. a lot you've seen before, but also a quite a few you may have always wanted to play as but couldn't till now... Most of the new characters are fun .. though there is one character that i've been deeply disappointed with.. Kushina Uzumaki.. aka Naruto's mother.. I always wanted to play as the bad ass Kunoichi with the nick name of the red hot Habanero .. a character that was supposedly know for her fierce strength, unique and power jutsus, advanced knowledge of sealing jutsus and creating barriers. so what did we get for her in the game? a women  dressed in a green dress that uses kitchen cooking equipment to fight..  like spatulas, frying pans, soup ladles and spoons.... a character with a grab move that has her flirt with the opponent before suplexing them into the ground and a ultimate jutsu that consists of getting PMS and pounding your enemy into the ground... wow.. talk about sexist.... anyways... besides this flawed character  their are a lot of great characters to have fun with..

The story:.. or should i say stories? much like generations, this game has more the one story..  1 decent length one and 2 other short ones for the Ninja Escapades mode, the Mech-naruto story in the Tournament mode and the world Ninja tournament mode that seems to be the main mode of the game. The Ninja World Tournament mode is where you'll spend hours and hours on and is a lot of fun as you run around a large island, gain ally's to help you fight, do one on one battles, collect items to customize you character's appearance and engage in the new battle orb battles. the battles orb battles are where you fight against 3 computer controlled characters that supposedly fight against you and the other characters but almost always gain up on you instead. Unlike a normal battle, you don't fight till you run out of health but you and the other characters each start the round with 1000 orbs and every time you damage the other characters you take their orbs and add it toy your total  with your opponents trying to do the same. For the world tournament battles which have D,C,B,A,S and SS ranked levels it's the same principle  except you fight 3 rounds in a row,  fighting each round with one of the several other characters you choose at the beginning of the tournament and your orb score is added to the 1000 orbs for the next character that's battling i tnhe next round.. the goal is to have the most orbs each round and the most by the end of the final round.. the battles themselves are more like the mob battles from Ultimate ninja storm 3
 then anything else.. all 4 characters fighting against each to her for orbs.. it's chaotic but fun.

There's also challenge missions, jobs and collectibles on the island and survival modes, standard one ion one fights mode against another person or the computer and more in the Free Battle mode on the game..

Overall is is a great game but if there are any complaints ( beyond not letting  Kushina Uzumaki live up to her potential as a character) it has to be the length.. the Ninja Escapades only last around 2 hours at most, and while the Ninja World Tournament and mecha-Naruto stories are fun it lacks the boss battles ,the long cohesive stories and side missions of Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 and 3..  it is better then Generations, but only just...

The Good: the Graphics, the abundance of characters, the new team ultimate Jutsus, the counter breaker, the new drive mode option, the anime cut scenes for the Ninja Escapades mode.... it has a lot going for it...

The Bad: Kushina's move set, no boss battles, short overall length, no single cohesive story and doesn't advance the main plot of the previous game at all.

Pros:
12-hour talk time is for real. I played a 14-hour COD4 marathon and didn't run out of power until hour 14.
Noise canceling is excellent. No echoes when listening, and doesn't register my breathing! Comes with a wall charger, and can also be charged via USB with the same cable as your controller. It can be worn on the left or right side, and has it's own mute/volume control.

Cons:
While I think it's comfortable, there is no adjustment for the behind the head loop. If this is for a younger person, or if your head is just small then it may not fit too well.
The earpiece is heavy (must be that 12 hr battery) and wants to slide down if you move around. Without any way to adjust the way it fits this is NOT a headset made for walking down the street, it's for stationary use. The head loop is  also cheap feeling compared to the earpiece. It begs careful handling because of the springy feel and how thin the plastic is. Also, you will have to pair it again after you use the wall charger, but not when you use USB. Strange, no?

Ayumi carries two gun-blades that she can either hack and slash at monsters, or she can shoot them.  Also, as you collect souls from fallen monsters and broken objects in the environment, you'll be able to purchase magic spells to help aid you in your quest.

The gameplay is simple, yet fun.  Of course it doesn't hurt that the main character is pretty hot and wearing a thong.  You go from one level to the next and can't pass on to the next until you've killed all the monsters in the area.  Sometimes you have to just kill everything, sometimes there are monster generators that you have to destroy, sometimes there are special elemental monsters that can only be killed with a certain spell, and then there are boss fights.

The graphics in this game are actually really good.  The only thing that I found odd with the graphics is the lighting, which they seem to overuse alot.  There were sometimes when Ayumi would just disappear into a bright glowing light.  And there's a couple of levels that take place on a beach, and it looks like Ayumi's skin in glowing red like she's got the worst tan ever.  Other than that, the character models and the environments look really good.

Sound wise...the soundtrack is actually pretty good with it's rock and techno beats.  However, the voice acting was just god awful.  The guns sound powerful like they should though.

The game is kinda short, maybe 5 or 6 hours long.  You could probably beat it in one aftertoon if you really wanted.  But I personally had so much fun playing through it the first time that a few days after I beat it I started a new game and am about to beat the game for a second time.  After you beat the game, you unlock new costumes for Ayumi to wear, which is kinda nice.

All in all, it was a fun experience.  Just don't go in expecting a great story with well thought out characters.  If you're just looking for some mindless fun with some good eye candy to look at while you're doing it, then you probably can't go wrong with X-Blades.",X-Blades Review,1237852800,12,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
4.0,False,"03 15, 2005",A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0002ILS24,Michael Kerner,"Nintendo has always found so many creative ways to revamp a lot of their classic games to the maximum. That definitely hits the mark very well most of the time. Back in 1997, when Nintendo 64 was popular, and with so many games to take it to the limit, Star Fox 64 was the most revolutionary game not just for the system, but defined the feel of vibrations that made you feel the game, thanks to the N64 Rumble Pak. Yet, Nintendo has tried to make lightning strike twice for the Star Fox franchise for quite sometime. They've tried it a few years ago with Star Fox Adventures, fairly well, and now it is about to be done all over again.

Star Fox Assault, the latest game in the Star Fox series goes through ten outrageous missions that take you on foot, in the air with the arwing, and in the tough landmaster tank. The story of the game deals with Fox McCloud and his team who try to destroy the plague of aparoids trying to destroy Corneria, Fortuna, the dinosaur planet from Star Fox Adventures Sauria, and so many other outrageous galaxies in the way. The graphics and storylines are remarkably delightful, and maintain to the game far beyond the previous Star Fox games.

The gameplay is great, but there are a few downsides to the game. One of them is the control of the game, especially on foot. If you haven't played Star Fox Adventures, it might be a little tricky at first to control Fox, Slippy, Krystal and Falco on foot in versus mode, and Fox in the story mode. However, it gets a lot easier along the way. Another disadvantage is that the methods of defeating some of the bosses in the game are ways of defeating similar bosses from Star Fox 64. One example is the Pigma aparoid in Level 5: The Asteroid Belt. The method of defeating him is a similar method of defeating the Area 6 boss from Star Fox 64. So for some, it does lack a few challenges here and there.

Overall, Star Fox Assault is a very delightful addition to the Nintendo Gamecube lineup, and is a joy for longtime fans of the Star Fox Series. I honestly recommend this for truly dynamic sci-fi Fox action. This is no aparoid of a lie.

I was able to play this game with both a yoke and a rudder pedal, but when I bought the 2004 version I had neither of these.  Since I had to use my keyboard, I was at first concerned that my controls would be very shacky.  It was at first but soon I was able to get used to it.  This game has great realism.  It has great graphics and although I am not a real time pilot, I'm sure the plane arobatics are very acurate.  As a casual player, I bought this game purely based on my joy of simulated flying.  At playing for a while, I soon started to worry that I would get bored of it quickly, but this was not the case.  This game has great replay value.  One of the most amazing things about this game is that you can create a custom flight, and you can litterly fly anywhere in the world.  At the time I bought this game I was taking a WWII history class, so for fun I wanted to see where these battles to place.  I was able to fly over the English Channel and over the Pacific islands.

Three  Enemies will attack you when it's your turn.

This game is a blast.  An EXCELLENT alternative to GTA.  I'll break up my review into a few sections...

Plot/Gameplay.  Its a 3rd person shooter.  The guns range from conventional to the wacky and absurd.  A dub-step gun, and one that shoots people into space.  Later you gain superpowers...super stop the ground, telekinesis.. and so on.  Tons of fun, but sometimes I wish I could turn off super sprint.....;)

Sound: You can customise the music you listen too.  The rest of the music is great.  Though for some reason when you reload a gun it sounds pretty quiet.  Not a huge deal breaker, just something I noticed.

Graphics: They're OK.  I've had it freeze on me twice during a UFO mini game, but no other issues.

Fun factor/replayability:  To me, it was a blast.  The missions got kinda repetitive towards the end, but not enough to make me stop playing.  Currently, I've beaten the game and am doing the extra things: collecting chacter logs, clusters and the like.

Our first was Mystic Forest, and Nickel Alley, while older, provides every bit as much fun as the newer titles do. We're strictly offline slot players, so the lack of an online option in this title isn't a big deal to us.

I have installed on both 32 and 64 bit versions of XP, including Virtual versions. There is one glitch on the 64 bit platform, if you leave the game up without playing it you will occasionally encounter an exception error, but it has never occured during actual game play. So if you are going to step away for a bit, exit the game or you stand a chance of losing whatever you won during the session. Phantom has a patch on their website ([...]) be sure to grab it before you start playing. There are also numerous patches available elsewhere (Google is your friend) that allow the game to be played without having the CD in the tray. I haven't a clue as to why the other reviewer had installation issues, or invoked the dreaded ""System Instability"" warning - this puppy has played just fine on 4 different physical systems and three virtual ones.

4.0,False,"06 15, 2007",A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000G75AXY,Michael J. Tresca,"I put Lost Planet: Extreme Condition on my wish list because it looked like Gears of War crossed with Robotech, featuring giant mecha and tiny soldiers battling huge monsters in a frozen environment. That's more or less what I got.

Our hero, Wayne Holden (modeled after Byung-hun Lee and voiced in English by Josh Keaton), loses his father to a giant Akrid known as Green Eye. When the archvillain of the game is chiefly known by the color his eyes, it's an indicator that perhaps the translation isn't perfect. Or to put it another way, we don't call Godzilla ""Flaming Mouth.""

Anyway, Wayne wakes up on the same frozen planet, rescued by the tasty purple-haired Luka (Christina Puccelli) and her aggravating little brother Rick (Justin Shenkarow). Rick's one of those characters who always wears goggles, as if they're surgically affixed to his face. He's a staple of anime, the energetic techie that tags along with the hot chick to make her more effective, since said hot chick doesn't seem to do a whole lot besides make poor fashion choices.

Yuri (Andrew Kishino), who looks like a villain, complete with narrow gaze and white hair, leads Luka and Rick. With Wayne joining their merry band, they're ready to go out into the frozen world and steal stuff.

They're Ice Pirates...sorry, I mean Snow Pirates. Well, not really - they're actually the Rebels to NEVEC's Empire, battling on Hoth...

Wait, this isn't the Empire Strikes Back?

Which review is this? Lost Planet? Oh yeah, right.

Sorry, sorry, my attention wandered from the convoluted plot. It involves Wayne losing his memory, a bit of time travel, a weird glowy thing attached to his arm that powers the mecha (sorry, VIRTUAL SUITS...can't the anime community agree on a standardized term for these bloody things?), some rivalry between Luka and some other mannish-sound woman, and another bad guy (we know he's bad because he wears glasses) who wants to take...over...THE WORLD! MUAAHAHAHAHA!

This is a mech game masquerading as a third-person shooter. Wayne plods along, even when there's no snow. He stumbles when he jumps. Fortunately, he has a grappling hook that fires from his wrist and never manages to dislocate his arm. I ended up shooting the grappling hook at a lot of stationary objects and dragging Wayne along like a slower, dumber version of Spider-Man.

The other challenge is that Wayne requires heat to live. Fortunately, the Akrid provide it, which really motivates Wayne to kill them however he can. There are also huge vats of energy lying around that are just waiting to be shot up. What doesn't make nearly as much sense is why Wayne has to power up his heat energy when he's indoors. Or in a volcano. Seriously.

The Akrid are beautiful to behold. They are all weird, squiggly bug-types, each unique and varied and most of all HUGE. Lost Planet revels in the size of the landscape, throwing giant worms and massive moths at you as you struggle with poor mini-Wayne to get to a mech. Once you're in a mech, the game becomes much more fun, because you can move faster than a snail's pace and blow things up much more effectively.

The human opponents, also in mechs and on foot, are annoying and suffer from the I MUST SHOUT SOMETHING BEFORE I DIE syndrome. Every time. When you kill a lot of these guys, the slogans and rallying cries get old. The Akrid bosses, who don't speak, make up for it.

In fact, the game is all about the bosses. Each is innovative, challenging, and terrible to behold. However, Lost Planet is a game of attrition; on the longer levels it carries over the energy you collected in the beginning. Since heat energy and damage are tied together, failing to get enough energy or taking too much damage in an earlier part of the game can make a boss battle impossible. I had to restart two levels from scratch until I got it right.

But Lost Planet is addicting. I played it on hard and all of the boss battles were very close. Two of the boss fights ended with Wayne going through two mecha, a handful of grenades and a missile launcher. Now THAT'S a fun game!",Ice Pirates on Hoth,1181865600,5,,

The only reason that I've given this game 4 stars instead of 5 is because of 2 frustrating problems with the system.  First, whenever you leave the game to do something else (like read your email or get hints), you have to completely exit out of the game and then reload your saved game to start again.  Second, you have to point and click to move anywhere, and there is quite a stall between when you click, and when you actually move.  Once you get used to these two ""glitches"" however, the game really is a lot of fun.

""Return to Mysterious Island"" is about a young girl who competes in various boating competitions.  During one of these competitions, a bad storm occurred, and when she awoke she found herself without her boat, and on the shores of a deserted island - or what appears to be a deserted island.

Your ""job"" is to find various items strewn throughout the island, and combine them when necessary to come up with other needed items.  With the ultimate goal being to get back to civilization.

Most of what you need to do is logical - however, I still found it necessary to go to ""UHS Hints"" a few times to help me get back on track.  I highly recommend this website, as it allows you to choose how many hints to take, so if you just need a nudge, you can choose just a few hints - this way the result isn't ruined for you before you get a chance to try your own wits...

But you know what bothers me most about this game?  The trick system.  Most of it is just button combinations, like in a fighting game.  You don't feel much connection to the buttons you press and what the animations are doing.  It feels a little too restricted and just not that thrilling.  You can do a back flip but it's really slow - impossible to do two of them in one ramp.  As far as barrel rolls, well, there are none.  In Wave Race 64, they might not have been a big variety of stuff, but I was actually maneuvering the watercraft in the air.  When I would land a double barrel roll I let out a big fat YESSSS.  I never say ""YESSSS"" when I play this game.  But yeah, the water is pretty dang pretty to look at.  The rider models ain't too shabby either, although they all look pretty much the same.  I wish the game had a freestyle mode where it focused on pulling off tough tricks.  Even in free ride, I've tried to ramp around but everything seems pretty regulated.  Things were in Wave Race 64 too, but all you needed was an imagination as well as a little creativity and you could take that game APART, LOL.  But yeah, Splashdown's water is pretty dang pretty to look at.

Another thing is the music...  It doesn't appeal to my taste particularly - but that's just me  (I would have gone with a more generic aquatic sounding music that anyone could get used to).  I wouldn't say that the game sucks for its music though.  If you like Smashmouth and The Donnas (which I do not) then you'll be fine.  Even if you don't, just turn it down low and it ain't so bad since you're distracted by the pretty water.

4.0,False,"02 6, 2007",A2615K4AJSX078,B000069D75,H.Le,"I will echo what others have said that Gothic 2 (and Gothic 1) is really unlike anything else out there - for better or for worse.  Take a bit of time to read all the reviews for Gothic 1, Gothic 2, and also Gothic 2 Gold and it is literally smack-in-your-face obvious that those who can get over the beyond-description frustration of the bugs, the akward control, and the extreme realism  (in this case, the absolute wimpiness of your character in the beginning - a fly, albeit a good-sized one, will kill him) and actually finish the game, will have their whole perspective on gaming changed forever. On the other hand, those that cannot will despise this game more than their mother-in-law (anyone notice that you can get woman-Hitler by rearranging the letters?)

At any rate, it is absolutely true that the gamer must goes through his/her own trials before this game can be enjoyed.  Yes, combat is hideous in the beginning, but get use to it and you will have Conan peeing in his leather breeches.  Once you use to the control (and level up accordingly), the fighting movement is almost comparable to those sleek fighting game that's only available to console gamers.  The cool thing is that you can defeat much stronger enemy based on your wit and dexterity rather than by character level.  For instance, one of the ways to kill a giant troll in the game is by circle-strafing it rather that hacking it head on, because no matter what level you are at, this troll will just tear up your behind if you take it head on. By the way, enemies, especially those smaller than you, will also circle-strafe you, as they have impeccable AI. This is why the Gothic nuts love the challenge so much.

Beside the good story (Gothic 1 has a better story though), one of the best thing about Gothic, to echo another reviewer, is that it's so immersive it literally gets under your skin.  It won't be long before you automatically save game before combat without thinking - because the anxiety is almost too real.  It won't be long before you learn to dread the dark and fear the night - and the night is long in the Gothic world (a day is a little over an hour long - that means about 30 minutes of darkness - and if you are out in the wood - you tread very carefully, if at all). Those who did not play or finish Gothic will think I'm off my rocker. Those that did will probably lol and remember their own fear of dying mixing in with the adrenaline rush before combat.  For me, once I got over the frustration, it's simply too awsome to stop playing. (Pro: I worked hard at work so I can go home and play Gothic again. Con: I don't do anything at home beside paying Gothic ...again.  By the way, Gothic 3 is a very decent game (and very pretty graphically), but it tried too hard to please everybody; therefore, as the Righteous Brothers (if you remember who that is) would said, it ""lost that loving feeling"" that Gothic fanatics ecperienced in Gothic 1 and 2.

Another quirk with Gothic (both 1 and 2) is that it may not play on Windows XP if you have anti-virus running, as I have experienced. And also remember to clean up any spyware. Other than that, Gothic is more than a game, it's an experience to be felt, for those who knows that patient really meant: if first you don't succeed, reload, reload, reload... and keep on reloading the damn thing till you do. And just like my Drill Instructor used too say, ""If it didn't hurt, you didn't do it right.""

GOOD:
- Over 30 playable Marvel super Hero characters
- Four Player Co-op either all on one system or over Xbox Live (internet). When playing the game as a single player the computer plays as the other three characters and using the directional button you can switch at anytime between any of the characters on your team.
- All the playable characters have four different costumes to choose from (except for Moon Knight who has three), these costumes also give bonuses for things like fighting power and life power.
- Lots of powers and abilities for each super hero that you can upgrade, also it should be noted all the super heroes have their signature moves from Spiderman's web swing to Wolverine's Berserk Barrage.
- Travel to lots of different Marvel Universe locations form Namor's Atlantis to Mephisto's Realm.

BAD:
- Game might get repetitive for some since all you really do is beat up on villains and run around from room to room (dungeon crawler).
- The Voice Acting in this game is not so great and sometimes is out right bad.

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:
- A top-over Action RPG, which plays very much like Diablo but more so like X-Men Legends.
- To really enjoy this game you kind of have to be a fan of and know a bit about the Marvel Universe.
- Original Story that takes place in the Marvel Universe.
- Four player Co-op can be played in regular mode (which plays like the main game for single player) or ""Arcade"" mode where you compete for life/power ups.
- Collect coins to spend on leveling up moves and powers, kill enemies to level up your characters (and unlock newer moves).

I originally played Borderlands 2 with friends on the PS3 and while I enjoyed it then, I didn't follow the story since we were constantly talking over the game dialog. So I decided to buy the Vita version for a more intimate experience. This game has since become my most played Vita game after Persona 4 Golden and Need for Speed. I love exploring the varied landscapes, trying to follow absurd story-lines, and shooting sponges! Hard resetting the Vita has become second nature - this system usually locks up after I play for a few days (2-3hrs/day).

4.0,False,"10 8, 2010",APDK39G2PUQPU,B00005V9DX,ghillisniper300,"So this was the first game in the Hitman series I played, and it was given to me.  Also, I had not played many video games at that time in my life so I had not really fleshed out my likes and dislikes as much.  And now it has a bit of nostalgia such that I may still bust it out and play it from time to time.  Sooooo, I'm a bit biased towards the game, and I think I'm rating it a half star to one star above what I should.  Probably a half, so 3.5 stars, round that up to 4 I guess.

Anyway, the game is pretty good.  Graphically speaking it looks great for that era of games.  Physics are pretty good but the ragdolls are a little wild.  That added a fun factor when I ran around killing everyone and then shooting their dead bodies to watch them fly around.  Not very realistic though.  The gameplay was slightly less satisfying than Codename 47 but similar.  For one I like the money and purchasing in the first game (that I played 2nd) although I really liked the tool shed and having to earn weapons.  Basically, you earn weapons by using them.  It sometimes got a little confusing because I would only keep some weapons if I carried them out of the level upon completion, but others were awarded to me automatically after some map completions.  The suppressed silver Ballers and I believe a sawed off shotgun are awarded for Silent Assassin ratings, which is the only motivation for doing the missions as you should.

The biggest annoyance with this game is that you have to walk everywhere.  No running.  The AI in this game are super squirrelly.  I understand that running could be an indication that you are up to no good, but so is that crazy weird walk that Tobius Reaper likes to pull off when he's ""sneaking"".  In fact, I'd rather see a bald guy in a suit running past than to see him crab walking down the street.  But you have to just walk normally through most of this game and it is tedious.  Luckily they fixed that in later games.

Then there is the sometimes arbitrary values the game gives for aggression and stealth.  The stealth is less arbitrary and based on shots fired and people killed I think, but it is less intuitive than in later games.  The aggression can seem somewhat random and sometimes when you do a mission very well, you still get bumped out of the Silent Assassin ranking due to your aggression.  One particular mission always annoyed me, when you have to get outside the Petronas Twin Towers to cross to the other tower, the glass breaking would always alert the guards.  I've read that you can do it so that it will not, but I never could and that was the only thing keeping me from getting Silent Assassin on that mission.

Finally, the story is somewhat weak.  I enjoyed the story in this better than the other games because it seemed less disjointed; however, it didn't seem to work very well.  But now that I've played them all it seems to be the status quo in this series.

The real fun of this game for me was being able to mow people down when I felt like it, and sneak around trying to do it right when I felt like it.  The locations are well made with plenty of details and there is some motivation for trying to do the mission right, though you don't have to.

4.0,False,"01 3, 2016",A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B005EZ5GNW,JJ,"Before beginning this review, let me give my background as a Silent Hill gamer.  Previous to purchasing this collection, I had never played either Silent Hill 2 or 3 before; however, I had played Silent Hill 1, 4: The Room, Homecoming, and Shattered Memories; thus, I had some experience of this survival horror world.  With that being said, I definitely consider myself a fan of this franchise since discovering it about 3 years ago without being someone who's followed the series since its inception in 1999.  I give this brief and seemingly pointless background of me so that you somewhat know where I'm coming from when I negate several of the other top reviews of this game and argue that this game is really not bad at all.  Perhaps, it's because I missed the originals that had more fog or different voice actors, but I actually found that these games were well worth my time and money.

Silent Hill 2 is a standalone game in the series, so you need not have played any other SH games before diving into this one.  The story follows James Sunderland as he travels to the town of Silent Hill after receiving a note from his supposedly deceased wife.  The plot is timeless and should keep you intrigued for the entirety of the game.  The controls are a tad outdated, but I didn't find them to be much of an annoyance at all.  The graphics are also old, and I didn't really find them to be particularly HD, but I also didn't find them to be an eyesore either.  The music is wonderful at setting the mood, and the voice acting is spot on (I thought for both the old and new voices, which you do get to choose between).  The monsters are creepy and the puzzled are satisfyingly difficult.  This version of the game also has a follow-up story, which adds an hour or 2 of gameplay to the experience.  Overall, I have no major complaints about this game except, as expected, the graphics and controls are a touch outdated.  Otherwise, the game is just as enjoyable now in 2016 as it was when it first was released 14 years ago.

Silent Hill 3 is a direct sequel to Silent Hill 1, so if you haven't played the very first game in the series, SH 3 might not be the best game for you to start with.  Without giving much away, the story revolves around Heather who begins to have nightmarish experiences as she attempts to leave the mall and head home.  The plot takes a while to really get into, and once again, if you aren't familiar with the very first Silent Hill story, you're going to be confused as the plot progresses.  I found the controls to be really smooth albeit repetitive; the fixed camera angles were what killed me in this game.  Like SH 2, the graphics are old but still not painful to look at, in the least.  The music is creepy, and the voice acting may not be the best (nor does it match up with the subtitles), but my ears weren't bleeding too badly from any of the actors.  The monsters are also creepy in this game, and the puzzles were just as well done as in SH 2.  Once again, really all I can critique this game on is the not-so-contemporary graphics and the fixed camera angles; everything else made this game such a fun experience.

Some reviewers noted that there was a lack of fog in the games which ruined the experience; I did not find this to be true at all.  The fog levels were perfect for me.  Other reviewers complained about the voice acting, which admittedly isn't the best but also isn't the worst.  When Konami did not release a patch for this Xbox 360 version of the collection, people got really upset, but I didn't experience any glitches at all that need a patch.  Was I playing this game so intently that I was looking for flaws in the design or gameplay?  No, but I don't think that diminishes my opinion that this collection is a great buy for Xbox 360 owners who have either already somewhat enjoyed the Silent Hill universe or are looking for a way to become introduced to the series (SH 2 only).

4.0,False,"12 7, 2007",A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000K8YAKI,Michael J. Tresca,"I came into Halomania with Halo 2 on the original Xbox.  During the time we waited for Halo 3, I played Gears of War online with an expanding circle of friends, including the Geezer Gamers (look 'em up).  We chafed at the eight-man team maximum and were itching to play in the larger sandbox that was Halo 3.

My wife bought the Halo 3 Limited Edition the day it came out. Did I mention I love my wife?

There's been so many reviews about Halo 3 that there's little new I can contribute here.  The campaign is serviceable, but takes itself a little too seriously.  Viewing the web site for Halo 3 is unintentionally hilarious, treating the game like a World War II memorial, as if it has that much emotional gravitas. It doesn't; the hinted-at relationship between Master Chief (Steven Downes) and Cortana (Jen Taylor) gets a little silly at times, the stalwart allies die heroically, bad guys become allies and then betray you later, and aliens natter on about setting off the Halo rings and destroying the universe. The talking plant known as the Gravemind (Dee Bradley Baker) doesn't make an appearance, but his voice is ever present.  In fact, the game uses the awful method of flashbacks, both from Cortana and Gravemind, to interrupt game play and force the plot down your throat.  It gets old fast. The game reaches a rollicking conclusion with a crazy Warthog chase across collapsing platforms that recaptures some of the fun of Halo 2. The ending is predictable but well earned.

But forget the campaign.  The real beauty of Halo is the multiplayer game.  I play the game every Wednesday night (look for Talien) and we play Team Slayer with sixteen people at once.  It's great fun, and the boards provide an endless array of challenges that make Halo 3 the excellent multiplayer experience we've come to expect.

There are some changes.  The graphics are better, but not much better.  I miss the value of a perfect reload from Gears of War.  Speaking of Gears of War, Halo's environments aren't as destructible.  And my favorite tactic, two-fisted Needler-ing, has been rendered obsolete.  In fact, Needlers don't track nearly as well as they used to.

There are new guns and vehicles, but the biggest change is the ability to remove heavy machineguns from their mounts and walk around the board, mowing people down.  I've had more kills using this new tactic than using all the other weapons combined. As for vehicles, there's a new bike and an enormous beast known as the Elephant that I'm fond of driving (I flipped an Elephant once, ask me about it some time).  Speaking of war stories, there's also a neat function that allows you to view replays and share it with friends.

The packaging of LE of Halo 3 isn't very practical.  Made of metal, the package I received was warped.  Since the piece that holds the disc in the box is also made of metal, the disc was banging around inside the case.  Even the booklet, which is in the center of the container, was warped.  No wonder the discs in some copies were scratched!

Despite the changes from Halo 2, Halo 3's multiplayer can't be beat.  It's a testament to the game's staying power that we come back to it every Wednesday.","Halo's a bit tilted, but it still shines bright",1196985600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Many other games for 60 dollars only give a few hours of gameplay, but you get your money worth with this game. Lastly, I'm trying to live up to all the hype but it's just not there. The game becomes so similar it seems that there is a small change of maps and paint,  but the formula is the same. The formula is great and addictive, but as a COD bet it's starting to get boring and predictive. Nevertheless, the game is good and I will probably be spending a lot of time playing it before I move on to a new title.","It's Good, but not as good as the hype.",1446681600,4,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PS4 Digital Code'}",
4.0,False,"03 1, 2011",AQ81L25HHHB18,B0012RCNTQ,S.W.,"I have been a fan of fighting games for a long time --- although they seem to have pretty much fallen out of style, at least compared to how popular they once were --- and this is a great collection. I had played World Heroes 2 on the Super NES, but I never owned any version of it until I got this collection, and I had never played any versions of the other three games. They all have shades of Street Fighter II about them, but how many fighting games don't? The original World Heroes is very limited, so it isn't as fun as the other WH games, but they are all good, and feature some neat characters. While most of the characters are SF2-esque in their appearances and/or their move-sets, Janne seems more like Charlotte from the Samurai Showdown games (which are also by SNK). My personal favorite is Mudman, because he's so wacky. If you enjoy fighting games, I recommend this collection for you. I only have one major complaint, and it doesn't have to do with the games themselves so much as it has to do with the packaging. I don't know if anyone else has noticed this (I only read one review for the game), but on the back of the game box, there is something that is VERY misleading (unless I've missed something): It says, ""Witness the evolution of 56 characters across 4 games in SNK's greatest fighting game series!"" ""56 characters""?? It seems that SNK pulled a major bit of chicanery here. Apparently, they're counting EACH character's appearance in EACH game as an appearance of a separate character. For example, they're counting Hanzo as FOUR characters because he's in each of the games. How cheap is that?! This may technically not be false advertising, but it's still VERY deceptive, unless there are a lot of locked characters that I don't know about (and I'm not aware of any). Despite this, I give this collection four stars. (Note from 10-11-12: I recently got the Samurai Shodown Anthology for PS2, and I've realized that there are other characters besides Janne on the WH games who resemble ones from the SS games! For example, Rasputin from the WH series bears a striking resamblance to one of the guys from the SS series [forgot his name]!)","a great collection, despite a misleading claim on the box",1298937600,2,,

The main fault I would like to mention/note with this collection though, is that Sonic 3D blast's special zones (the collection of chaos emeralds) was a wth moment for me compared to the original Sega Saturn version I've played. The standard gameplay itself seems the same, with a unique 3D view and catchy music, but the chaos emerald collection stages were magnitudes better in the Sega Saturn version compared to the one in this collection, the one on offer here seems random/unplayable (I've tried it a few times and couldn't figure out how to work through it, and the format/graphics seem really bland compared to the game's standard 3d gameplay).  I presume that Sonic 3D blast must've had two versions (perhaps one on sega genesis and an updated one on sega saturn?), but it's a real shame that the Sega Saturn version wasn't the one that was included here, cause they were adrenaline-inducing and awesome.

Remember to get the female to female 5 pin harness if you're buying a Sanwa stick!

This stick has two big advantages over the Hori, with another potential monetary investment. First, it has an easily removable plexi that you can stuff with custom art.

Second, it works with many different consoles - provided you plug the appropriate controller into it (inconvenient). With a firmware update it also works with Switch; no Switch controller needs to be plugged into it either. Note: connect the controller/systems exactly as it says in the manual to save yourself some headaches.

You can circumvent the need for an additional controller with the purchase of ""MAGICBOOTS"" dongles. They are $20-$25 for each system with which you want to use the f500. They're not necessary, but convenient.

Some of the games I felt were lacking in the song selection, but this game has easily the most accessible and familiar songs.  Of the 40 songs, I enjoy singing about 35 of them.  There are some difficult ones (Bohemian Rhapsody) and some not so hard ones, but it's a lot of fun.  I am not going to waste time telling everyone what they already know about this franchise and how awesome it is especially when playing with other people.

So, I'll get to the reason I couldn't give this game 5 stars.  I would have loved to given it five stars.  This was easily the most anticipated game for me, maybe ever in my life, and I'm a life-long gamer (at 28 years old I've practically been raised by my Sega Genesis and Playstation 2).  I just don't see any differences between this and the last American Idol game.  Yes, there is Paula instead of Laura, but she's using the same phrases Laura used.  If they were going to take the time to do new sound recordings they could have re-wrote some of the dialogue.  Yes, there is SOME new dialogue for the three judges, but I've heard very few of the new comments.  The box promises new judge interactions.  I've yet to see any interaction between the three as there is on the TV show.  There are a couple new outfits thrown in to unlock but seriously, there are no new arenas, almost no new animations, or anything really new gameplay-wise.

This is still a great game for newbies and experts alike.  No one is going to be disappointed, after all the game is a singing game and its quality should be based on the song choice and singing ""controls"", both of which are perfect.  Personally, though I would have liked to seen something new.  New places to sing, maybe a new game variation or feature, maybe even the option to see your virtual opponents sing or be judged.  For instance, I am pretty good at this game so I rarely hear the negative comments and that is half the fun...I would like to see some of my virtual contestant opponents gets ripped by the judges before being voted off.

I'm not a huge Seacrest fan, but he's all over the show and no where visually in the game.

First off, the Tom Clancy games are my favorite Xbox franchise after Halo, and I loved the first Ghost Recon and the Island Thunder expansion pack despite their flaws, so when I first heard about Ghost Recon 2 I was pretty excited about seeing the final product.  Now that I've played the actual game for a while, I can't help but agree with other reviewers here who say that although Ghost Recon 2 may very well be a good game, it really isn't Ghost Recon.  Despite their occasionally rough graphics and overcomplicated controls, I ultimately think that GR and GR:IT were more unique and enjoyable than GR2.  I must give Ubisoft credit for being willing to go in a new direction with the sequel to one of their most popular games, instead of simply tweaking the graphics a little and adding a new feature here or there (EA anyone?).  Didn't like the fixed first person perspective of the first game?  Well, now you can switch between first person and an over the shoulder view.  Thought the menus were confusing?  Now they've been simplified and the selection of weapons streamlined.  Thought the command system for managing your squad was too complicated?  Now you just have one squad to worry about, and the command system more closely resembles Rainbow 6 than the original Ghost Recon.  In fact, the whole game seems much closer to Rainbow 6 than the first Ghost Recon, and therein lies much of the problem, I think.  Yes, GR1 was a little complicated, but once you did master it you had a wealth of options available to you in terms of both strategy and tactics.  GR2 is much more like a typical run-and-gun shooter in which you have a squad who backs you up (in other words, Rainbow 6).  Having one squad isn't too much of a problem for me, as I often went out with one in the first game to simplify matters, but the ability to switch between characters is sorely lacking.  In the first game you could be the sniper whenever that was necessary or switch to the guy with an automatic weapon whenever you needed to hose down a building full of enemies, but now you simply command your squadmates to do those things for you.  Ubisoft has also apparently eliminated in-door environments.  This is understandable given that the squads would often get stuck in doorways and such whenever you went inside a building in the first game, but I think they could have just fixed that problem instead of simply getting rid of what was an interesting element of gameplay.  The AI is also a little different- the North Koreans seem more adept at taking cover and protecting themselves than the Russians or Cubans did in GR and GR:IT, but their heightened aggression comes at a price.  In the first game the enemies basically patrolled a certain number of paths, which allowed you to observe them and then decide how to best attack them at your leisure.  In GR2 they simply spawn when you reach certain points at the game and attack you en masse.  Much of the stealth and strategy elements that distinguished the first game and its expansion packs are simply gone.  In its place you have a well-polished and nicely executed military shooter that bears little resemblance to its predecessors and is best enjoyed without any prior expectations.",Closer to 3.5 stars overall,1105488000,2,,

the combat is fantastic in this game, best enemies ever, leveling is awesome, pets awesome, steal system awesome and super fun, great music and sound effects, and the game is rather scary and thrilling at the same time.

the entire game is a huge dungeon crawl, so not much variety in the scenery, but  a fantastic map system more than makes up for this, you can never get lost really.  the game is dark overall and you're not going to be running thru any sunny meadows surrounded by bunny rabbits.  you're going to be in a dungeon or graveyard and its going to be dark

I got the PS 4 Battlefield 4 Launch Day Bundle and I was really worry because all the news I read about some of them causing problems and even overheating but lucky, mine was an exception.
Talking about the console, i'ts beautiful. The shape is gorgeous and the size makes fit it almost anywhere you can try to place it. So far I've been able to keep it turned on for more than 3 days straight without any kind of problems (I was downloading some video games).
The console was bundle with a copy of Battlefield 4 China Rising and a PSN Plus subscription, I don't want to wast my time on the game but focus on the subscription, I was completely against it because you need one to play online and that really sucks but now that I'm part of the PlayStation ecosystem I changed my mind. I'm not only getting some ""free"" games for my PS 4 but for my PS 3 and PS vita too and for $59.99 the year!? Get out of here!!!
The games for the PS 4 are, sometimes, bold and short but still great to play. Is going to be matter of time to get my kind of games in the roster
The games you get for the PS 3 are great and most of the time are AAA games from previous years (like when I got Bio shock Infinite, Dead Space 3 and Crysis 3). Even though you don't need the PSN Plus membership to play online, the benefit resides on the amount of discounts you get at the PSN Store.
And finally the games for the PS Vita are as good as the PS 3 versions you get. I've been playing vita for 3 months and now I can't believe the time I wast not buying it before. And the greatest thing is that my gf can play ps3 while I enjoy playing ps4 using my vita or just my vita :D

I would have been cranky if I paid fifty bucks for an 8 hour campaign to be honest, but as I paid less than half, I cannot complain.  I could imagine playing through the game over and over as a fill in between major game release cycles.

It'd be great of the studio and publisher went ahead and enhanced the single player campaign with more installments.  The ending sort of leaves you hanging (you defeated the russians, but the chinese are now ready to fight)

5.0,False,"07 29, 2014",A2582KMXLK2P06,B000SMMOFO,Bryan,"Crystalis is a classic that very few have actually played which is unbelievably unfortunate!  Its reason for never seeing the type of popularity as other overworld-exploration type adventure games is somewhat mysterious to me, unless the Super NES being an instant sensation is responsible meaning too many people moved on to the Super NES.  This game has no flaws that I can think of.  Usually NES music tends to grate after a while and gets annoying to the point I have to hit the mute button, but not only is the music throughout Crystalis listenabe 100% of the time, it's quite often really memorable too.  There's one theme that reminds me of the chorus from Michael Jackson's ""Smooth Criminal"" which is probably only me who hears a similarity since a quick google search doesn't give me any results when I type in both Crystalis and Michael Jackson.

I have to warn you though- this game is so gigantic, perhaps the biggest game I've ever played on the NES, that you absolutely NEED a FAQ of some kind (preferably online) to help get you through these many elaborate areas.  This is a great hack and slash type adventure with a character that moves WAY faster than any other NES game I've ever played.  Seriously the speed is surprisingly fast.  In comparison to Link, Mega Man or Simon from the NES games, this little dude can RUN!  Anyway the challenge comes not from the regular enemies you encounter that help provide you enough money to buy healing and magic items (and their drop rate is so frequent you'll never have to worry about money for anything by the way) but by the CONSTANT confusion in figuring out where to go and what to do.

Anyway there's SO many caves, and the overworld is pretty big too (but not as big as the one in the original Legend of Zelda) that you'll be spending quite a lot of your time just getting to know this place.  One or two playthoughs isn't enough to feel comfortable with your surroundings either.  More like 10 playthroughs.  Given how fun this game is however, you'll probably be playing it up to 10 times if not more.  Also there's quite a lot of towns and townspeople to communicate with.  The text is really intelligent and detailed for an NES game which I'm sure any huge RPG fan will instantly notice.  I can't really think of any other NES games with so much detail in the text.  Put it this way, there's a lot going on in this game.

You have a level up system too.  It works the same way as in many other games- attack enough enemies and you'll eventually obtain enough points to move up another level which helps keep the challenge into bearable range.  I won't lie though- the boss fights can be absolutely brutal if you don't have the right magic items.  Be prepared!  This game has a nice selection of powerful magic abilities as well.  You can buy this stuff in town.  My only complaint about the game is that the second half is more about talking to townspeople and travelling to more towns and less about the cave exploration.  Perhaps the developers felt we needed a break from all the caves.  This also means less enemy fighting in the second half but the storyline is pretty good so I suppose it doesn't matter.  Expect fetch quests too involving collecting items and bringing them back to the people in town for a reward or storyline progression.  You'll probably need a FAQ for this stuff.

I still remember seeing pictures of this game during the NES years 20 years ago.  I loved how colorful Crystalis looked in particular compared to all the other games at the time.  Nintendo Power loved showing the cave areas of this game.  I really should have purchased this game as a kid, or asked for it as a Christmas/birthday present.  I'm surprised I never did.  I think I moved on to the Super NES and focused on that console, and when I did I sort of pushed the NES behind.  Too bad since there were still plenty of great NES games worthy of my time.

I strongly recommend this game.  It's fun, the caves are challenging, the storyline is detailed, the characters are pretty memorable though nothing on the level of Final Fantasy of course, and the action is nonstop exciting and FAST.",adventurous to the max,1406592000,,,

I grew up playing Pokemon Red and Blue, so although that series holds a lot of nostalgia for me, the series has become less interesting as time goes on with little variation to the same basic formula.

Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth is different.  It doesn't adhere to the simple formula to which Pokemon has long clung: one-on-one battles, a linear evolution chart, and minimalist story.  Instead, it offers you a significant amount of freedom in choosing which Digimon you want in your team and how you want them to grow.  Each Digimon can digivolve into multiple other Digimon of your choice, each with different requirements on how you've raised the Digimon (growing into some of the more powerful Digimon means you need to give them a bit more care so that their stats reach the requirements).  You can also de-digivolve a Digimon back to an earlier state, allowing you to grow it back into another type of Digimon of your preference.  This process can be very addictive if you're the type who's eager to collect them all -- 249 in total, and due to the digivolution mechanics, it's actually much less time-consuming than capturing the original 151 Pokemon in Red/Blue/Yellow.

The game also has plenty of sidequests, which I love in an RPG.  They tend not to be particularly creative, but they're quick and offer some nice rewards.  Because the story places you in the role of a detective, these sidequests come in the form of cases that are posted to the detective agency's bulletin board.

While you won't find the same monster-catching depth as the Shin Megami Tensei series here, the game does offer a level of depth that's substantially higher than that of Pokemon, and it offers mechanics that are creative and bring a fresh approach to the genre.  And if you enjoy this game, I'd recommend checking out the holy grail of the genre, Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne.",One of the most interesting monster-catching games in years,1464048000,,{'Color:': ' Playstation 4'},

One of the most lauded side-scrolling shooter series in history has reached its last chapter.  Irem's appropriately named R-Type Final has come to the PS2 thanks to Eidos' Fresh Games label, and it is a bittersweet occurrence.  On one hand, Irem has said that this game marks the end of the venerable R-Type series.  On the other, it's more than a fitting curtain call for the franchise.
The basic gameplay hasn't really changed much throughout the series.  RTF is not a manic, reflex-frying bullet-dodger like last year's Gamecube masterpiece, Ikaruga.  It's a more methodically paced, strategic game that feels different from most shooters.  For one thing, R-Type has always been less about score and more about simple survival.  Enemies approach from all sides, from waves of drones to screen-filling bosses.  You won't dodge incoming fire as much as plan your progress, find and take advantage of tiny safe zones, discover weak spots, and time your counterattacks.  R-Type tests your memory, reflexes, and anticipation, and can be demanding.  You will have to learn attack patterns, measure to the pixel where to wedge your ship, and learn to manipulate the infamous Force Module (the ubiquitous detachable satellite that is immune to enemy fire).  There is a measure of trial-and-error here, but the reward of reaching a new level or taking out a troublesome boss always makes the effort worthwhile.  R-Type Final sticks to these well-worn conventions, but this is more than a simple case of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""
One major improvement is in the technical department.  The last installment in the series, R-Type Delta (PSone), was a fantastically realized creation that sported some incredible level and creature design, some of which were updated versions of bosses and enemies from the original R-Type.  RTF continues this tradition.  There is a level that consists entirely of travelling along one huge spacecraft, taking it apart piece by piece.  Fans will recognize this, and love it.  Bydo mutants appear on all sides, and you'll battle mechanical, organic, and cyborg foes, all amidst a beautiful shower of effects and scenery.  While there's no doubt that this is the best-looking R-Type, it still retains the details that identify the series.  And don't worry - the occasional slowdown can actually be a help.  Delta's speed control also returns, and the game has five difficulty levels.  The easier levels will drag a bit for the shooter veteran, but jack it up to the insane ""R-Typer"" to experience the game as Irem intended.
There are, however, a new feature or two that must be mentioned.  The first is branching levels.  Depending on your performance within levels, you may visit one of several different sequences.  It doesn't feel added on or superfluous, keeping the levels flowing like nothing happened.  But it is a welcome addition, especially when considering the other, more drastic new feature.
R-Type Final has around a hundred ships to fly.  That's right:  100.  Quite a difference from Delta's mere four!  The ships vary wildly, from recon versions to transforming fighters, each with their own unique weapons.  New craft are unlocked by performing various in-game tasks, like total flight time with specific ships or completing branching paths.  This gives the game quite a bit of replay value, as unlocking all of them will take many hours.  Some of the ships aren't nearly as cool as others, and some verge on being overpowered, but the constant reward process keeps you motivated.
You can now also customize your ships.  Before you fly, you can pick ship & canopy color, missile type, bit type, etc.  This helps you stick to your own style of play, and keeps the game fresh and interesting.  How you equip your ship can have a lot of influence on how the game plays.
Yet another new feature is the A.I. Battle mode.  Rather than being a head-to-head two-person battle, this lets you pit your ships against a friend's (or the game's A.I.) in computer controlled combat.  It's fun to fool around with, but you'll more than likely be done with it quickly.
Irem says R-Type Final is the ultimate installment in the series, a ""Thank You"" to R-Type fans everywhere.  It's hard to argue either point.  While there will undoubtedly be those who question the new additions to the formula, in the end, RTF stands as a brilliant modern dedication to one of the premiere side-scrollers.  It is sad to see the series end, but what a wicked way to go out, indeed.
Thank YOU, Irem.","Going out with a bang, not a whimper",1075248000,19,,

5.0,False,"04 17, 2009",A2J6D6D0NB1G44,B0000A92KZ,RR,"Hell yeah man, Max Payne 2. The original was ingenious in a simplistic way and Maxy Payne 2 brings back all of the good things, fixes the bad, and brings more things to the table. This game is awesome, definitely worth the $5 it cost buying it used from Amazon.

It's been 2 years since the events of the first game, Max has cleared his name and is now working as a detective for the NYPD. During a crime scene investigation he comes across Mona Sax, the girl from the first game he thought had died. They run into contracted killers dressed as 'cleaners', they must escape and find out who wants both of them dead.

The game started off a bit slower than the first, there's a lot more story this time around. The developer's tried to beef up the story to make the game a more complete package. I remember playing through this years ago and thinking it blew away the original, but this time around I didn't see it.... until it got to the point where Max and Mona are working together. It's almost as if the game decides you've had enough 'training' with easy kills and switches it up to some dope stuff. Max and Mona are at a construction site, running through an empty building but they're in different locations. There's a bunch of guys hiding behind pallets, boxes, pillars, and when you go in there guns blazing you just see stuff flying everywhere. The bullet time lasts much longer this time around in order to encourage you to get into the action. You also get to play as Mona at times, as well as be accompanied by her or other characters throughout the game.

When you activate the bullet time, the screen turns into a sepia tone and everything slows down except your aim. Imagine taking cover when you come across a room with 5 guys, you throw a grenade from behind cover, activate bullet time and rush in there mowing guys down with your uzis. Max is out in the open and has to reload so he extends his arms out and does a crouched 360 spin like in the Matrix, which helps avoid shots. Those that turned to run away are caught by the grenade blast. Nice.

The environments are much better this time around and you encounter more enemies which leads to more action. In this respect, Max Payne 2 is much better than the original. Still no puzzles, thank God, just pure action.

Gone are the dream sequences where you had to balance on a blood trail in a space of nothingness. I guess people complained enough. Instead, the dream sequences are back but you're simply running through a hospital. At one point you encounter a double of yourself who has been locked up and accused of murder. He pleads his case as he runs away from you.

""I've been FRAMED!""

hahaha! That's classic, the voice acting and story are the same as in Max Payne. I'm glad that I was buzzed for that one. The story got kind of involved with conspiracies from different characters from the first game, I found it hard to connect all the dots. The part of the story that made sense to me were the events there were currently happening. Regardless, the cut scenes with the story board illustrations were even better and gave the game personality. Max still has dope lines:

""I was compelled to give him back his gun.... one bullet at a time""

I can keep going off on the good things, there's plenty of health available, no shortage of guns and ammo, the quick-save feature guarantees you don't have to replay any area just because you died. It always feels like you're making progress and never felt like a chore playing it. When you beat the game, you unlock harder difficulties, the 'New York Minute' mode, and a survival mode where you have to stay alive while fighting endless enemies. It's dope. When you beat the game in the hardest setting, you'll get a different ending.

I can't end this without pointing this out: As the title indicates, this is the ""Fall of Max Payne"". Quickly you'll see why: he stopped being OTFABS. It's almost hard to believe. A lot of the perdition he gets himself into is because he's whipped. Most of the time I was in disbelief, ""What the hell man, don't do that! You gotta be OTFABS! Ah, well no choice but to kill all these guys now."" If he were to remain OTFABS the game would have ended in the first act.

5.0,False,"04 29, 2006",A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000930DIM,David Foskin,"One of the most anticipated games this fall is Burnout Revenge, the follow-up to last year's Burnout 3: Takedown, which actually garnered some votes for ""game of the year"" from a variety of publications last year. From being able to smash into traffic to improved visuals, the sequel has improved upon its predecessor in almost every way, and it even got faster. Yes, faster.

Burnout's ""revenge"" factor is noticeable right off the bat. For starters, the A.I. for the other cars in the race has been improved and is now noticeably more aggressive. No longer do they passively drive next to you; they want you out of the race as badly as you want them out. When you take another racer down, rest assured they will make returning the favor a high priority. The game also encourages you to takedown opponents that have caused you to crash, highlighting them as a new ""revenge rival"" before the smoke has even cleared from your wreck. It doesn't seem like much, but it really gets you fired up to take make them pay for taking you out. There are new ways to take down opponents this year; from running traffic into them to simply taking a jump and landing right on top of them. Rival cars actually seem to position themselves under you when you get big air, so landing on top of them isn't quite as difficult as it sounds.

The game also features a new Traffic Attack mode where your goal is to slam into as many cars as possible while racing through town. You'll get a goal of totaling a certain number of cars, and a short amount of time on the clock. As you smash into traffic (they must be going with you, not towards or perpendicular to you), you get more time added to the clock. In addition to there being a certain number of cars to hit to earn the gold, there's also a target number to earn a trophy. Traffic Attack is so much fun that you won't need the added incentive of a trophy to keep smashing cars well after you've earned a gold.

Burning laps, which where many people's least favorite part about Burnout 3, are back, and they are just as frustrating as ever. Driving a flawless lap with the game's faster cars is difficult, and racing the same course ten times in a row to shave off a few seconds is nowhere near as enjoyable as slamming into traffic or taking down other cars. Sure, they help you learn the course, but they're not much fun.

Crashbreakers are a little more effective this time around, and different cars have different power levels for their crashbreakers. The camera is still problematic, which makes steering your car into a passing rival mostly a matter of luck. Should you nail someone with a Crashbreaker, get a Takedown, or just drive dangerously (yet successfully) you'll be awarded points and a ranking at the end of the race. These rankings open up new challenges and courses, and are a good incentive to play more. You'll often find yourself playing ""just one more"" to get your level up before turning off the game.

Crash mode has been revamped, and despite it being hyped as ""golf with cars,"" which really doesn't sound that appealing, it isn't dissimilar from previous incarnations. There's a meter on the left side, which is ripped straight from Madden's kick meter, and you must hit X near the top, and X near the bottom to get god starting speed. Hit the X button too late near the top and you'll blow your engine; hit it too late on the way down and your car will stall. It does add a little bit of strategy to the mix if you don't get the optimum start, but for the most part it's a frustrating and rather pointless addition. Wind is also a factor this year, as you must take it into account when launching your vehicle off a ramp. For some reason a 20mph wind can wreak havoc on your two-ton vehicle, so lining up your jump to compensate for the crosswind is key. Like the starting meter, this feels like an unnecessary addition.

The good news is, once you get moving, crashing is just as fun as ever. Gone are the crash multipliers (something I liked), but their removal does give you more freedom as to how you're going to tackle a challenge, so it's not the end of the world. A ""target"" car has been added to the mix, and it's primarily a bonus car that comes around late into your crash, provided you've caused enough carnage to last that long. The camera is still problematic, often not showing the action from the optimal angle. This is mainly an issue when you're about to deploy your crashbreaker and launch yourself into a new group of cars. The camera shifts at the last instant, forcing you to orient yourself while madly pounding the R2 button to charge the crashbreaker. All in all, it's just as good as last year, and perhaps better, depending on how you like the start meter and the wind.

The game's tracks are also an improvement over last year's, not only because they look better, but because of new shortcuts. These shortcuts will save you tons of time, which is a necessity when trying to get a gold medal in burning laps. Most of the shortcuts are marked with flashing blue lights, making them easy to spot, but you still need to have a decent idea as to where they are because you're often going so fast that you're passed the shortcut by the time you see the lights. The shortcuts are generally light on traffic, but they have their own hazards, like narrow paths, jumps, and junk that flies up when you hit it, obstructing your view. They are high risk, but they are also high reward.

Controls are as tight as ever, and there's really no way they could be improved. Load times are frequent, but they've been shortened a little bit, and outside of crash mode, where you're constantly re-starting, they're not really an issue.

Burnout Revenge supports online play, but actually getting online is a rather cumbersome experience. You'll need an EA account, which requires an email address, password, and usually several tries at a nickname - since so many are taken. If you're behind a firewall, or you're using a router, prepare to spend a lot of time learning how to open ports, because without certain ports open, you won't be able to play at all. Many people who aren't technically inclined won't be able to get online with the game, which in my opinion is inexcusable. If you think you fall into this category, and you've got an Xbox, then the Live-enabled version of the game is the way to go.

Takedown was one of the first games to use the 900 degree rotation feature of Logitech's snazzy $150 Driving Force Pro wheel, and anyone that invested in the wheel will be happy to know that Revenge can utilize it as well. Using the wheel is a great way to play the game, and there's really almost no learning curve involved. You might not do as well right off the bat, but after a few laps you of whipping the wheel around and feeling the intensity of the force feedback, you won't want to go back to playing with a regular controller.

The cars look more realistic than ever and are quite shiny, showing off real-time reflections. Like the vehicles, the courses are more realistic this year, and there's a great amount of variety to them. From industrial downtown areas, to snow covered mountains, there's a little bit of everything. Even the menus and trophy clips are snazzy; you can tell that a lot of time was spent polishing this game to perfection.

The framerate is for the most part, rock solid and lightning fast. Somehow, it feels faster than the last Burnout, which is quite an accomplishment. There is some occasional slowdown, but it's rare and never affects gameplay. The game has a gritty look to it, so the colors are a little muted, and everything seems to have been run through a filter to give the game a more natural look. Sparks, flames, and vehicle parts fly during crashes, adding to the mayhem on screen. I found that the in-car camera view, which is my preferred view, isn't very useful because you can't see what's on either side of you. I was constantly getting slammed into walls by the aggressive CPU because I couldn't see they had me lined up.

Revenge supports 480 progressive scan, but the only way to implement it is to hold the X and triangle buttons down when the first loading screen comes up. It doesn't make a huge difference in how the game looks, but it's certainly something you'll want to do if your TV can handle progressive scan. It would have been nice for this to have been placed in a menu somewhere, especially since the X and Triangle trick is nowhere to be found in the game manual.

One of the best things about Burnout Revenge's audio is there's no more announcer. He's nowhere to be heard this year, which is, as anyone who played Burnout 3 will tell you, a good thing. Sadly, EA Trax didn't get the boot, and the soundtrack is just as much of a mixed bag as it always is. It's heavy on punk and rock, which would be a good thing if it was more than a bunch of new bands, who in my opinion all sound the same. If you enjoyed last year's songs, then chances are good that you'll like what you hear this year.

Sound effects are another of Revenge's strengths. The cars all have unique engine noise, ranging from the high pitched scream of a sports car, to the throaty roar of a truck. Crashes are filled with the sounds of breaking glass, exploding cars, and metal being ripped to shreds. All of the sound effects are solid and add to the overall experience.

If you were a fan of Takedown, you should already own this game. The same goes for anyone that enjoys racing games even a little bit. Hell, you should give this game to your mother for Christmas. It's that good.","Fast, very very fast...",1146268800,3,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Pros:
- Most comfortable mouse I've ever used
- Rubber gripping on the side adds more comfort and prevents gross slippery feeling if palm gets sweaty
- Long-lasting. 3 friends use this same mouse, and 2 years is the longest one of them has had it and it still works
- Can customize the colors on the lights
- Can unlock the scroll wheel and just let that thing scroooolllllllll (not that I care that much, but it's a lot of fun)
- 6 extra buttons (aside from clicks and wheel)
- Can download Logitech software to customize button functions, such as ""Back"" and ""Forward"" in a web browser
- Comes with little weights, which is kinda cool

Cons:
- Not much customization with the lights. Can make the lights ""breathe"", fade between random colors, or solid color. Can adjust brightness
- Kinda wish there were more lights on the mouse. The only lights are the DPS indicator on the side and the ""G""
- $70 is a lot of money for a mouse. But I've bought one of the cheap similar mouses on Amazon before and it lasted for 3 months before the middle click stopped working consistently. So for $70 this one is supposed to last a long time.

5.0,False,"01 5, 2010",A20A607Z2JJMXK,B0013064LA,Jimmy,"I picked one of these up on the advice my friend gave me. All I have to say is WOW. Before, I had been relying on recharging double A batteries. They worked fine at first, but started acting up in the controllers, taking some time after being pulled out until the controllers got used to them. They would turn off constantly, sometimes in mid-game which was becoming unacceptable for online stuff like L4D2. All I can say is forget that these are even third party. There's nothing negative about them. Sure, had Microsoft made them, they might look a little cooler, but the price would likely be close to twice as much. They work like a charm and hold a better charge than any of my batteries did before hand.

The only negative thing I can really think of is that the light on them, which is a pretty bright. Enough that it illuminated my ceiling tiles. If you have them in your bedroom and charge them before you go to sleep, this might be a problem for you until the lights go off, which shouldn't be that long unless they're totally dead. Even with that, I still give them the five star rating. The charge is great and the ease of the docking station beats wasting cash on normal batteries, fumbling around with rechargables or even Microsoft's own Play & Charge Kit. The double dock is great as well. If you have an extra controller, even if you single player most of the time, it's really nice to have. If one does die, you have a backup ready to go while you charge the other.

UPDATE: I've now had this charger for over four years now and the charge is still as good as new with constant playing in that time and I've never drained the batteries completely, which for a lot of rechargables can lead with issues. Also, there are newer models out which seem to be just be cosmetic changes (they're now black and it seems they fixed the bright light issue.)

5.0,False,"12 26, 2002",A3E0MSKBIWMU6F,B00006GSO1,obryanstars,"I just can't put into words how awsome this game is; but I'll try.  There are so many moves, gadgets, details in every aspect...here goes:
The gameplay: Incredible!  This game should easily win game of the year!  Why?  It's so realistic, so breathtaking, so nerve wracking at times that you really feel that you are Sam Fisher.  Here are the basic moves: You can crouch, roll (to move quickly through one area without being seen), jump, double jump (jump off a wall to cling on to a pipe at the top), split jump (where your up against the wall doing the splits.  You cant then jump down in surprise and knock out your enemy, or shoot him), cling to pipes (and move around, even hang from it while shooting down a guard).  Those are just a few!  You can knock people out, put a gun to their head and interrogate them.  Use people as human shields, hide against walls, knockout anybody, slide down a wire, etc...  So many moves, all so very cool, you'll really feel like a secret agent.  Now with these moves, you must make it through dozens of levels to prevent a war from happening.  If caught, the U.S. will have nothing to do with u.  You're on your own.
Gadgets: Thankfully, with these awsome moves, you have perhaps the coolest gadgets ever thought up.  You have gadgets to unlock doors, look under the door, climb walls, shock people to death, etc...  So many cool gadgets!  You'll need every one of them to get through this war.  But that's not all!  You later on get cameras that you can shoot into a room to see everything before you enter, giving you time to plan, think, etc...  These cameras though (so cool) can also, when pressing the red B button, make a loud whistling sound that will attract guards.  When they are close, push the yellow Y button, and a sleeping gas will enter the air, knocking the guards unconscience, and leaving your path clear.  These cameras also have night vision, heat vision, and of course, regular vision.  So many uses, these cameras may save your life more than once.  Use them wisely.
The game: In the game, you must get through different levels, finding out secrets in various ways, and doing whatever is asked of u.  U can read e-mails from hacked computers, listen in silently on conversations, hide dead or living bodies (you can either knock them out or put a bullet to their head).  Sam is also equipped with heat and night vision goggles.  So when you have been spotted, and several guards are coming your way, you can shoot out nearby lights, split jump and watch blind guards come in.  Put your night vision goggles on, jump down, put a gun to one's head, and use him as a human shield.  Shoot the others, knockout your hostage, hide the bodies, and move on.  So many options of doing almost anything during gameplay, you'll be spoiled of how to beat each mission...or come back later and beat it on a harder setting.  You can also pick up and throw bottles, coke cans, anything.  The whole process of the game is very cool.
The graphics: In case you haven't heard, this game has some of the best graphics ever seen in a game.  One of my friend's walked in, sat down, not seeing the controller in my hand.  He thought I was watching a movie for a few seconds!  That's how good this game looks.  The lighting is fantastic.  Knock out all the lights, pitch black.  Leave a tiny bulb on, a lite glow fills the room.  Very cool!  Sam even changes.  He rolls up his sleeves, breathes in and out, steadies his gun when running so as to not make a clit, clat noise.  Etc...  So much detail put into everything.  Even things like when Sam's hands are busy (like hanging from a pole), he cocks his head up, then down, to get his night or heat vision goggles on.  Sooooooooooo realistic!
Depth: Incredible!  On the normal setting, you'll be lucky to beat this game in less than 30 hours.  And the ability to go back and beat the game on hard later adds even more replay value!  This game has it all!
Overall, this game rocked in every aspect.  Even sound (perhaps the best ever in a game) is ignored because of how good everything else is.  Voice acting is so realistic, as Sam always sounds confident, and yet sometimes doubtful, and even a bit nervous.  You can hear how fast you're running, the footsteps of approaching enemies, the true reloading of your gun (which ranges from silencers and snipers, to machine guns at times), and the shells falling to the floor.
This is a classic, a must have, and any gamer should feel left out never playing Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell!
(And oh, later on, you may be able to download new levels from the internet so your PC.  So cool!)

Graphics- 5star - amazing i would say they are on par with heavy rain graphics, they fully utilized the power of the ps3 for this game.  The in game movies and the gameplay graphics are both the same graphics(for most games graphics in movie are way better than gameplay)

Story - 5star - Awesome storyline, very interesting always keeps u entertained and on the edge of your seat.  Im also a huge fan of greek mythology and this had tons of that.  I think this is one of the first game series to tell almost all the major greek myths, which is very cool.

Music - 5star - Game had overall great music and voice acting was flawless...I did notice on a few parts the audio cut in and out a bit (very rare, i tihnk only like 3 times through game) but it came back almost right away.  This could have been issue with my audio settings not sure though.

Controls - 5star - Great controls everything flowed together flawlessly, i really liked how they put the action buttons during scenes on the sides of screen (X, O, triangle, and square)In first game they had them all in same place which made it tougher to be able to tell which one is was in fast paced scene.  This time they lined the action buttons up with controllers setup which is triangle on top, circle on right, x on bottom, and square on left.  Another change i liked was for opening boxes they made it so u just hold down R1 instead of having to click it fast.

Weapons - 5star - Weapons is this game were amazing They had 4 different main weapons  Fiery Blades, hades scythes, hercules huge gauntlets, and Hephestus's awesome chain blade things.  I loved how they did the magic and weapons, and also they had items that used stamina.  In old games they had 4 main weopons which u could rotate and 4 main magics which were on d pad.  Now they have weapons on dpad and every weapon has a special magic ability that comes with it.  There are also the 4 spells that use yellow stamina Agility boots, fiery bow, blinding head, and i forget the last one.  But stamina is definatly cool in this game it recharges after u finish using those skills.

Overall this game is very amazing game with lots of hidden items and bonuses.  Great replay value especially to get all the trophies.

5.0,False,"05 15, 2001",A2179IYDJAZNLQ,B00004Y57G,Amazon Customer,"Well when I played FFVII, due to a friend's reccomendations, I thought, okay, what is this?  FFVIII was better but the plot was bad and the characters were not involved very well.  Squaresoft did make it all up with FFIX, I decided to also give this one a chance, and I immediately fell in love with it.
The characters are more involved, and the CG scenes are awesome and the plot was very detailed and never got boring.  It starts out with the main character, Zidane, and his theif crew planning to kidnap Pricness Garnet of Alexandria, except when they go to get her, she wants to go, but her guard Steiner won't let her go, and he ends up going along whether he wants to or not.  The game gets more involved but I won't tell you anymore.
What I liked most was the old style of FF games where only 1 person can do a certain thing (black magic, white magic, stealing, etc.) unlike in FFVII and FFVIII, where all characters can use anything, that makes it too easy, I like a challenge when I play a game.
My favorite character, undoubtedly was Vivi, he wasn't that strong using physical attacks, but his black magic was really handy later in the game in difficult boss battles.  My friend, the one who suggested all those other games, didn't want to try it, but I told him how nice it was and he borrowed it and he loved it.  In fact he borrows it whenever he can, and I can't get a chance to play it a second time, and I want to really bad.  Well anyways, I think this game is one of the best FF games on the Playstation, and probably will be the best so far, but I don't think Squaresoft is planning to stop making these games.

5.0,False,"04 26, 2006",A3AKZZ6SB06RB5,B000BC38LA,Adam Sugarman,"The Elder Scrolls series has always provided gamers with enormous, open-ended worlds, epic storylines, and games worth hundreds of hours of gameplay.  The more I play Oblivion, the more I realize that I've only just scratched the surface of what it has to offer.  It the first truly epic single-player PC RPG in a very long time (probably since Morrowind, really), and worth every penny of its purchase price.

While Morrowind (its predecessor) took around fifteen hours for the main quest to even hint at truly beginning, Oblivion pits you at the center of a royal assassination right from the get-go.  Emperor Uriel Septim VII (you know, the guy that alwasy gets you out of prison in these games) once again believes you are the only person who can save the world (as if there was any doubt.  Honestly, show me an RPG where you DON'T save the world).  He and his gaurd come plowing through your prison cell, open up a secret passage in its wall (if only you knew about that earlier; might've saved you all this trouble), and lead you underneath the Imperial City prison.  While in the process of escaping, Septim is killed right before your eyes, and you are given the task of finding his illegitimate son, now the rightful heir to the throne.  After that, though, you are set absolutely free.

From here you can go anywhere in Cyrodiil, from the hundreds of individual dungeons, shrines, lairs, caves, forts, and (evntually) Ovlivion gates to the multiple major cities dotting the map.  The wonderful thing about Oblivion is that it allows you to ""fast-travel"" to any location you've been to already, as well as all of the cities, so it eliminates a good deal of useless walking.  Although, to be honest, much of the fun of this game is just exploring the wilderness, not knowing where you're going and discovering what Cyrodiil has to offer to adventurers like yourself.

In fact, I challenge anyone NOT to get sidetracked in the process. While travelling through the wilderness to a waypoint required by the main quest you might get attacked by a bandit,  The bandit, you learn, is guarding the entrance to a three-level fort.  Your curiosity piqued, you venture inside to discover it is inhabited by 20 or so bandits and one vampire.  In the process of clearing the place out (and looting it, too), you get infected with vampirism.  Now you need to feed on the innocent every twenty-four hours, or find a cure.  This is all in light of the fact that you have yet to get to that waypoint you'd forgotten about twenty minutes ago when you enterred the fort.  You exit, determined to complete this mission, just to find a cave inhabbited by trolls.  And so it begins again.

You will never long for something to do.  While Morrowind dropped you in a strange world, kicked you in the face, screamed ""survive, if you can!"" into your ears till your brain hurt, Oblivion is a much kinder beast, at least at first.  It has a greatly improved quest and map system, so you always know what you need to do, where to go for it, how it needs to be done, and when (if that's the case).  It's very clear, but still manages to lack the linear feel of japanese style RPGs.  The enemies scale their levels in relation to your current level, so you'll never wander into an area with creatures 14 levels above you.  Some people have misconstrued this to mean that your enemies are always at the same level as you, but this is not the case.  What the system does is release enemies of a certain level once you reach level X.  For example, you won't start seeing full-sized scamps till around level 7 or so, but the stunted scamps that you fought earlier are still the same level 3 or 4 (or whatever specific number they were) that they've always been.  The only thing that consistently changes is the loot, abilities, and armor of your enemies.  This can sometimes break the realness of the world, but I prefer it to the harshness of Morrowind.  Also, combat is much more fun and realistic than in ES3, as is the wonderful orchestral soundtrack.

The same skill-based leveling that was in effect in Morrowind returns to Oblivion.  In order to level up armor, you need to have things hit you a lot.  To level up Blades, you conversely have to hit other things a lot.  It lets you control and tailor your character very specifically.  Also, you get certain bonuses when you do finally gain a level depending on how you play.  You can play however you want to, too.  If you want that stealth-empowered archer who can enchant like the devil, then so be it.  Also, if you absolutely MUST be a martial arts master who can heal himself and allies in battle, then darn it, you may.  It feels just as good as it did in Morrowind, and it works even better in the context of the new world.

Now let's get to what everyone's been yelling about in the Elder Scrolls official forums: the graphics.  You better have a monster for it to run well.  My suggestion is to check how it runs with your graphics card (which seems to be what makes or breaks the FPS).  My system is low-end by the game's standards, so I had to turn down all of the graphical settings.  It runs anywhere between 15-30 FPS for me, depending on the environment.  It's at its best in tight places, like the dungeons, and there can be awful slowdown in bigger environments.  If you do have that monster system that everyone else envies, though, you are in for a treat.  When it runs at full capacity, it is absolutely breathtaking.  The game still has a few bugs here and there marring what could be a near-perfect game experience, but nothing that really affects gameplay.  The game does crash to desktop, so be sure to save, just in case.

Oblivion is one of the greatest PC RPGs ever released, so if your computer can handle it, you'd be missing out on greatness if you passed up the oppurtunity to play.  I do suggest getting the strategy guide, though, if you're new to the series.  It really helps point you in the right direction if you don't know where to start with such an enormous game.  It has arrived, and reached greatness; now go buy it.  Now!

I understand that the series does an excellent job of simulating the feel of driving, but I've typically opted for more arcade-y racers.  Well...until now.

With this wheel, Gran Turismo Prologue is suddenly a blast to play- primarily because you'll feel like you're really driving a car.  The force feedback offers a perfect tactile recreation of the sensations cause by turning, crashing, etc.  It can't be left unsaid, either, that it feels very nice to use an actual gas pedal rather than just hitting ""x"".

Like the beginning wine enthusiast that can't tell the difference between a cheap merlot and an expensive one, I'm fuzzy on the details.

The NPC's are great getting to know and complex, but what it comes down to me is story, and this game has that.  The individual story of your PC that you shape and are shaped by, the Hawke family's story, your compatriots and the world, all ingeniously interwoven.  The world is full of grays and there is no Ideal.  The morality choices are philosophical and the outcome of your choices are unclear.  At times I stared at the screen knowing what my companion wanted and believed in with all of them, and I believed was wrong.  They did not forgive me or come around.  No side is the correct side.  No side is the right side.  I played as a mage and was stressed; I didn't want to be the center of this attention and I didn't want to be the one who fixed or decided everything, because none of it was obvious.  I would love to say more, but I don't want to give anything away and I'm still processing.

There are problems- reused environments and maps; they're beautiful, but exactly the same.  The plot is not very plotty- your character does not have a clear goal, so it does feel unfocused, but to me, that is the life of this character- your champion did not sign up to be champion.

The combat is exciting, the mage throws very cools spells, the rogue flips around, I have loved playing both.  The skills for the classes are very cool and allow you to be a mage who excels in healing or damage or elements or a little of each, for example, warriors and rogues also have many possibilities.  Ally AI is good and you have much more tactical control if you want it.  You feel powerful, battles are fun, the story is complex and compelling, the sound is top notch (everything from spell effects to voice acting), and visually it is beautiful.  This is a rare game.  There are aspects of it that are not traditional.  I've heard the complaints, but think that they are based on expectations on what this kind of game usually is and are initially uncomfortable.

This was great because she is the one with the bow and arrows, which can be controlled using the motion sensor controller in slow mo.

To cut to the chase, this game is about building cities in ancient Egypt. In my opinion, the fun in playing games is about doing things that you can't do in real life, and city-building in ancient Egypt is a good example of one of those things. You will start by building some humble cottages and maybe even a well for your people. You will have to provide food, water, entertainment, health care etc., and as you do so, your city will evolve. If you need more money, you can build a tax collectors office. You decide how much tax the people are going to pay. Low tax will make you poor but popular (at least for a while), and high tax will make you richer but less popular. But then again, money is needed to make the city better. As your city gets bigger and better, you might even consider building the ultimate construction in the game: The Pyramid(!) If you're not interested in history now, I almost guarantee you will be after playing this game. I can't think of a game that has given me more hours of fun than this. Oh wait, the other games in Sierra's City Building series actually have: ""Caesar"", ""Caesar II"", ""Caesar III"", ""Caesar IV"", ""Master of Olympus - Zeus"", ""Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom"" are all made with this same great city-building-recipe as Pharaoh.

It is sad when you need to steal a game to get it to work right... because everyone steals it. They are punishing their paying customers. You can be sure that any Games for Windows LIVE games are loaded with DRM, but just like most other Microsoft security features they can be bypassed.

Anyways, the gameplay is great. You will go to all the places you couldn't in Bioshock 1, like out in the ocean. Graphics are top tier for the ultimate Rapture experience. Now you can use plasmids and guns at the same time. Since you are playing as a Big Daddy, you get your own little sisters. They say things like ""Daddy's mad!"" when you get attacked, and ""Angels talk about mommy. Who is that?"" when they harvest adam. This made me extremely happy. The little sisters are a lot cuter this time around too.

5.0,False,"08 27, 2009",ASVVP0GAALXLR,B002AU0HZQ,D. Swanson,"I first discovered Professor Layton and the Curious Village when it was released and quickly became a fan of the series. With Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, my love for the series remains the same. After completing the story line of the game I learned that all in all, this game has over 138 puzzles with a few hidden extra puzzles that I have yet to unlock. In addition to this, there are more puzzles that can be downloaded via Nintendo wi-fi connection. So if you love brainteasers, this game is chock full of them just like its predecessor. What makes the Professor Layton series different that just a collection of brain teasers is the mysterious story line attached to it, as well as it's wonderful art style.

The gameplay consists of Professor Layton and his apprentice Luke as they explore through charming European-like villages and a train all while trying to find the answer of the cryptic Elysian box. As you explore, there are puzzles that you come across that you can solve. If you get stuck with one of these brainteasers, there are hint coins you can find allowing you to unlock up to three hints per puzzle (which can come in handy for those tough ones). At the ending you'll have needed to solve at least 80 puzzles to be able to beat the game.

The story line for this game was nothing that I would have expected, which is good. I hate figuring out the ending at the beginning, but I honestly had no idea and was surprised in an unrealistic turn of events in the end. (I think I found a plot hole, but I don't mind pardoning it because the idea was original enough in the first place). Anyway, The story is illustrated through fabulous animated cutscenes and makes you crave for more as you wish to learn more about the intriguing characters that you are presented. There seems to be more voice acting than the first game as well. Also if you have not played the first, you can easily play this one because there are no spoilers to the first one in this one--there are returning characters, but you are not told how you met in the previous game.

Where this game is better than the first:
I like being able to explore multiple places/towns.
I liked the addition of Flora in this game, even though she does not solve the puzzles herself, she does join you at times.

Additional features that are so/so:
There is a tea mixing minigame, it's fun, but can be frustrating trying to figure out the exact ingredients.
There is a hamster minigame where you try to make the hamster lose weight. (Wii fit anyone?)

Any negatives?
Well, the story did seem way out there and unrealistic, but thats okay, at least it was not predictable.

All in all this game is definitely worth 30 bucks and is refreshing, charming and a workout for your brain. I am totally jealous Japan already has two more games and movie and can't wait for the next one to be released here.",Professor Layton does it again!,1251331200,18,,

I was/am a huge fan of Oblivion. I really enjoyed Dragon Age but I am more a first shooter type and managing a group is less entertaining for me than single player/single character.
I was interested by The Witcher 2 so I read many reviews and something coming back all the time was indeed the mention of the original game.
So I tried it, hell, it was only 9.99$. It took about 2 hours to download the 11GB of the game and I started playing it. I am still playing it now.

The good:
- One of the most interesting story I have ever played so far. I am only at chapter two and I must have played at least 20 hours already. Easily...but I like to take my time and play all the side quests before progressing on the main one.
- Well designed game.
- Unusual fighting style but it gets quickly easy.
- A bit more realistic than Oblivion as far as looting. You cannot carry 20 armors in an invisible backpack. You have very limited slots for weapons and none other than your body for the armor.
- Excellent Alchemy and Ingredient collecting process.
- Works very well in 3D (with Nvidia 3D glasses).

The less good:
- I would have liked a possibility to gain skills at negociations, specifically to buy or sell items at a better price.
- A few minor visual bugs. For instance, the dwarves often have their right hand graphically messed up; it will form a columns towards the ground. A female monster (forgot her name) has her breasts doing the same thing but going down to her hips... I am quite sure it is a bug, otherwise...

Conclusion:
A solid 5 stars. It has replaced Oblivion now as my favorite RPG game and I hope the new one will live up to its predecessor. I will certainly add more impressions when I finish it but it won't certainly be soon.",Excellent surprise!,1314057600,,{'Platform:': ' PC Download'},

5.0,False,"03 10, 2002",A1BVIANDXCX7RW,B000062YIN,AMM,"I bought this game and I can't stop playing it.  Sega Rally was one of my favorite games on the Sega Saturn (Sega Rally 2 for DC was horrible...the control was so broken!).  NEVER has a video game for any console or PC conveyed a sense of environment as well as Rallisport Challenge does.  The graphics are PHENOMENAL...everything from the clean, jaggy-free car models, grass, rocks and roads...it all looks so lifelike and solid!  And the lighting...when the track indicates ""early morning"", ""Rainy afternoon"", or ""evening"" as it's conditions, believe me, the tracks and the way they are lit are completely convincing.  You'll drive through some of these tracks (the most impressive are by far the Mediterranean, icy racing and hill climbing tracks) and you'll swear that you've actually driven through locales like this at some point in your life!  And yes, on the hill climbing sections you CAN tumble off the side of the mountain which to my knowledge has never been done in a rally racing console game! Another bonus, check out the cool reflective mapping on the cars!
How's the gameplay?  In one word: PERFECT!  The game is challenging, but never to the point of controller-throwing frustration.  You'll find that part of the game's appeal is to find out exactly which car is suitable for the circuit you are going to attempt.  Here's a bonus tip....if you want to relive the glory days of Sega Rally 1 on your Sega Saturn, the Nissan Skyline and Lancia Delta control almost exactly like the default Lancia and Celica in SR1!  You'll find yourself practicing to get the art of powersliding down...it's not easy and the trick eventually comes down to using the handbrake in tandem with the normal brakes on the sharpest curves.  Believe me, once you finally have it down, being able to powerslide through the sharp turns in succession is one of the most skillfully satisfying abilities you can have as a gamer!
The career mode is where you'll find yourself the most.  This consists of racing a small circuit of races--normally about 3 - 10.  The object is to come in first in the points total so that you can amass the most points in the career totals to unlock new courses and cars.  Great fun and you'll find yourself replaying many of the circuits with the new cars you unlocked to see how much better you can do!  There's plenty to do and see and the races actually require some skill unlike the plethora of NASCAR games on the market.
The only downside is the soundtrack...just some generic techno that doesn't really do anything for me.
Is Rallisport Challenge the best racing game on the XBOX?  I think so...",Awesome! This is how Sega Rally should have been!,1015718400,12,,

It is a little on the short side to actually just complete but as with other Lego games, replaying missions and getting everything takes a while.  I think this is one of the better Lego games, especially on a hand held.  The music in it is excellent and there is a lot of variety.  The controls are very tight and the game mechanics work well.  This game has two save slots, which is nice if you'd like to start the game over with out losing all your progress or if another person wants to play the same cartridge. Also, ""dying"" in a level doesn't cause you to have to start that level again from the beginning....you just continue to respawn as your coveted stud count continues to drop with each ""death"".  I think this game is probably over looked by adult gamers who are fans of Lego games or even of the Ninjago series and that's a shame because this game is excellent. The character count is massive and can be confusing for someone who is not very familiar with the show but that adds to the challenge.  My only complaint at all is that if you want to replay each level on free roam IN ORDER from the story mode, you'll probably need to look that up and write it down then proceed.  The reason is the story mode sends you to so many different areas of the map, in no memorable order that it would be sort of hard to remember the order.  Or you can just use that second slot to start a new game forgoing all your hard earned characters.  There is no real open world free roam---you fly from ""level"" areas on the dragon.  There are a few goals to be met while flying but nothing major so the dragon really just moves you to levels you can choose after beating the game.  This is not a let down since the only Lego game I know of with a decent free roam open world stage on the 3ds is Lego City.

I prefer the sim approach as opposed to Tigers more arcade style although I think both are great games. I really like the graphics in Links as well as the sound effects and music. Links also has online play which is fun but I have actually spent most of my time building up the stats of my created guy. You can also download several courses over Xbox live although I have yet to do that so I can't say if they are worth it or not.

It depicts war as a theme park ride. It has a ridiculous plot with a middle eastern and russian bad guy, and an anglo good guy. It celebrates gun culture.

All of those are some of the worst aspects of life in America. But you know what? They're also part of American culture. So it is what it is.

now, as a piece of art, this really impresses.

The level design is really smart, inventive, and imaginative. The way that the game engine is used to depict experiences like climbing up an ice wall is exhilarating. You go on high speed chases, you make daring escapes. The events depicted in this game are out of reach of Hollywood, but are possible here thanks to the magic of digital design.

The weapons in the game are...guns.

They're not really accurately depicted. Recoil is minimal. setup times are arcade-like. You have tons of bullets and are never in danger of running out of ammo. When you reload a half-empty magazine you get all the bullets back.

But somehow they're depicted better than Battlefield 3. BF3 by the way has superior technology all around. But in COD, when you aim down the sights of the gun, part of it blurs out of view, just like what happens with a real gun. In BF3 this isn't the case. The guns in BF3 also sound like a zipper when fired.

The BF3 comparison actually is an illuminating one, because in contrast, COD is more artistic, and there are so many small little ways that they use their inferior engine more intelligently than BF3.

Anyways, about 2/3rds the way through I just played stupidly and ran around shooting without bothering to aim.

What else...the MP is okay, but not that compelling for me. There's mostly just team deathmatch, and I'm not the best at it so I get around a .5 k/d ratio. There's some level up system, but again, not really interesting. The thing is it's so arcadey that it's not interesting. Like, you never really have to count bullets, for instance, or worry too much about recoil. Also, you'll hear plenty of 12 year old boys talking in between matches and that's annoying. I actually find Red Orchestra 2 more enjoyable MP.

Anyways, get the game for the single player campaign. Don't take it too seriously. This game is basically like 24 meets God of War. It's definitely worth playing through.",A cultural monument for better or for worse,1358121600,,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},

In it, you play a survivor of a plane crash who also happens to find by some strange stroke of luck an underground city called Rapture lying deep down the Atlantic Ocean. The first minutes of the game are just simply amazing and frightening as you try to make sense of what is going on. One of the most frightening moment is when you enter and encounter face to face the founder of the city as he talks to you for the first time. Personally this was one of the many goosebumps I got. But the most frightening is in the surgery room when you find some tonic, you look behind you and then...

From the start, the atmosphere immerses you into the game, from the creepy fifties' music to the spooky and morbid lighting around this strange ghost town and the very impressive voice acting to the animation of the character's which are excellent. Loved the powers that you get during the game, especially the telekinesis and the one with the bees. Though you never are to sure of what your character really looks like, if you are very careful, just before you get to meet Andrew Ryan, the founder of Rapture, you get to see photos of you and also learn a shocking revelation.

I just love this game, it can be as hard as you want it to be so stop saying it's easy.  Anyways, this game was put out 8 years ago and still every once and a while I decide to play this and I love it, cuase it has the talking animals on it.  I'm going to repeat this TALKING ANIMALS!  Slippy gets on my nerves though I just kill him becuase he always gets some guy on his ass and keeps bleating ""get this guy off my fox!""  I wanna crack his skull everytime he says that it pisses me off.  Then theres that stupid chick that knows Falco (the bad ass of course) and she is annoying, I wish I could kill her becuase when you go to the Z zone she steals your kills so you can't get the freaking medal I HATE HER!  It is so annoying that she steals your kills!  Oh that has to be the worst part of the game, it's woefully madening.  Also to not are the apes who try to kill you, though they make the noble animal of the ape villanious they still have memoriable lines like ""ANDROSS I'VE FAILED YOU!!!""  Then there is team wolf, they are tottaly bad!  They are pretty hard to kill on the other side of venom but like I said if you got the skills you may one day beat them (and you say this game is too easy!  OH MY GOSH!).  Anyways I do like the bunny guy what's his name?  I forgot but he's like ""Your the best Slippy."" and that makes me want to cry becuase they are always so hard on Slippy!  I love it that they actually give him love in Aquos cuase I've heard the stories, poor Slippy.  Anyways Fox is a stud of course, damn he is looking good!  He works hard of course, cuase I'm controlling him.  Anyways the best characters are the bosses cuase they say stuff to you that's funny like that one boss ""admits defeat"" but then comes back after you cuase he was lying, what did you think you'd get off that easy!  HECK NO!  Anyways I hope you love this game as much as I do, becuase I say those lines everyday before I go to sleep, cause it bring hope.

* Super-stylish gameplay with ultra polished mechanics - meaning it was easy to do awesome stuff and look cool while fighting with no control frustration.
* Fun boss-fights - not insanely frustrating ones... just huge bosses to fight that were a challenge but not impossible.

I finally took the dive and got the game and have to say, if you like the demo, getting the game is a no-brainer. I enjoyed the heck out of it, it is more of the stuff you like from the demo.

The story isn't too bad, it has it's moment of campy-ness, but really it is just a vehicle to get you out of the door and into the action-packed fighting which is the best part.

I thought that the lack of gore from fighting all robot enemies would bother me (I am a big action/horror/etc. fan) but it felt so good that I never felt shorted with the lack of gore. Very family friendly action and just flat out fun.

The graphics are excellent for the fast paced future shooter, constantly running at a smooth framerate (I never noticed any stutter). Nothing really more to say, if you grab the demo on PS3/Xbox 360 you can tell in about 10 mins if this is your type of game or not... if the demo bores you, then skip it, because the full game is just a lot more well-executed content like the demo.

If you dug the demo like me, then buy this, you'll enjoy it :)

P.S.> This is a single player experience only, no multiplayer. The replay value would come from trying to get higher scores between levels and go for achievements or finding the little figurines through out the environment.

Now, I love playing Halo CE, 2, 3 and now ODST.
ODST brings something different to the table, instead of the same Master Chief from the other 3 games, you are an ODST, you are weaker and smaller.

When you're the ODST, you just can't go out and attack 5 Brutes at one time or you'll be dead before you know it! Instead, you have to make a more hesitant approach, picking one or two off at long range, then sticking any ones closer to you, then meleeing/shooting any up close. I found that more fun than just going in all guns blazing and not worrying about a thing.
As the Rookie, you travel through the Mombassa streets at night, searching for clues to your separated squad, also you will find audio logs that explain about the Covenant attack on the city, (if you find all thirty, you get an achievement).
There are a total of six squad members, you play all but 1, (Dare).

When attacking the Covenant, they are much more intimidating than before, Grunts and Jackals almost look you in the eye, Brutes look huge and Hunters are just monsters!!!

Firefight is a new and very fun way to kick some Covenant butt! I have played it many times solo and with friends.
There are `new' things in ODST, (really, nothing new, just the Brute plasma rifle from Halo 2 and Engineers, weird lookin' things).

There are no Energy swords in ODST, only hammers. It seems to take a lot more Needlers to make and enemy explode. If there are two Hunters, (sometimes only 1 are around) one of the Hunters fires its Fuel Rod cannon like the handheld one, (one direct hit and you`re dead!)

Disk two has ALL the Halo 3 multiplayer maps on it, plus the three new ones, Heretic, Citadel and Longshore. In case you never bought the Limited Addition of Halo Wars, but wanted Sandbox, Orbital and Assembly--here it is!! I never bought Halo Wars, so I got SIX new multiplayer maps in disk two!

I have had ODST for over a month and a half. I was never going to pay 60 smackers for it, so I waited and bought at a lower price. I could see paying $60 for it would be too much.

There are new boarders, new courses, and new tricks.
Sure, your favorite boarders and courses are still here this time around, but all have had a makeover. Like... Elise's new hair cut and the fact that Snowdream is no longer the first, and easiest course to contend with. Oh, and you heard that celebrities did most of the character voices, right?

The new riders are quite an eyeful.  From the gorgeous Marisol to the outrageous Psymon, the new boarders offer more than just replay value, they add more personality to the game.

In the last SSX, you could bump riders out of your way and have no worries of reprisal.  Well, not this time around!  If you knock down another rider, better watch you back! They will remember it.  There's an agression meter that tracks how much other riders like or dislike you.  So play nice and leave the race in one piece, or play rough and wind up off a cliff.
The new courses are a breath of fresh air.  And the redesigns of the old courses range from challenging to maniacal.  If you thought that the Tokyo Megaplex was insane before, you ain't seen nothing yet!
Other than the redesigned and new courses, the most dramatic change is UBER Tricks.

Yes, Uber Tricks.

Once you've done enough tricks that your adrenaline meter is full, you can perform an Uber Trick.  I won't try to discribe them, but I'll name a few: Proper Propeller Air, Magician Air, Guillotine Air, Torpedo Air, and Near Miss Air.

This was the fourth entry in the Call of Duty franchise, and the first of the ""Modern Warfare"" trilogy spin-off of the series. Released in 2007, the game was a massive success and sold millions of copies and it deserved the success and praise it got.

 The media frenzy, cultural impact it had was nearly unprecedented and the feel and controls that COD4 had were unrivalled by any game I had played before and in the years since, it has remained my favorite game of the series.

 Although the game's title says ""Call of Duty 4"", the story line completely breaks away from the World War II themes of the first three and is set in the then-near future with a bloody civil war erupting in the Middle East, and also another civil war in Russia between a weakening government of moderates and 'loyalists' on one side, and a vicious ultra-nationalist movement lead by a ring leader named Imran Zakhaev and a British Special Ops team is sent out to track down a nuclear device that has gone missing and attempt to stop the ultra-nationalists from taking control of Russia.

 The story mode of the game built on what is now, a kind of stale theme plot, but back when the game came out, it was very well-written and lots of fun to follow as well. The characters, although a bit hard to follow immediately eventually became very 3-dimensional and eventually to where you wanted to learn about their histories.

 The graphics are absolutely amazing, even if the game now shows it's age and the sound effects were groundbreaking and very realistic. This made the game one of the most intense and adventurous military shooter games of all time in the closing months of 2007 through the middle of 2008.

 The multiplayer was so much fun and had really amazing sound effects, excellent and very detailed (By late 2007-standards) graphics and realistic looking sceneries, and very brutal, realistic sound effects which made it worth the many hours I sank into playing it. It's a shame that now many mods and hackers have made it almost unplayable nowadays but playing ""COD4""'s multiplayer was great fun back in the day.

Second - Free vs Pay

Free:
Event skins, game updates, all maps, all future game modes, ability to play as a monster/hunter you don't own if you happen to join a game where the computer is controlling.
This means if I join as hunter and pick one you don't have, then I leave, the system will take over so the team isn't down a hunter. If you join then you can take over the hunter I was using even if you don't own it. Same goes for the monster.

Pay:
Monsters and hunters unless they happen to do some give aways like with the skins.

DLCs are optional, you don't have to buy them. However they are there if desired.

Keep in mind, if you have monster race edition you get 3 monsters (2 more coming out for 5 total) and 12 hunters (or is it 16 due to coming out hunters). That's 15+ combinations to choose from. The reason this game costs money to get it at first is due to the quality of design.

Costs aside, the biggest glitch I've come across is that my game will randomly lock up the first time I boot it, usually traversing menus. Leaving it be will cause it to catch up then no problem. I believe this has to do with the FXAA, disabling it makes issue disappear, but it only happens once on game load up and it looks better with it on so I deal with the initial lockup. Please keep in mind the the bugs presented in most reviews about bugs, namely on steam, have to do with the alpha and beta version. The current retail is not so glitchy.

However, it is very repetitive as any fps is. Different skill levels with Monsters/Hunters is what makes the game change up a bit. The game itself is genuinely fun so don't let the reviews deter you if they are old or are simply agrivated that future hunter/monster/skins are dlcs, and even the new ones I've seen describe old bugs which I assume is from some people playing ripped beta versions.

April 26, 2015 - UPDATE

RECOMMENDATION: I just seen a new player get frustrated and quit after a few days on the forums. His post was filled with inaccurate initial feedback about mechanics due to not paying attention to the playable tutorial, individual video tutorials, nor checking forum guides of any kind. This is not a standard team fps like counter strike. There are lots of tactics and mechanics to learn, as well as community favorite strategies that need to be learned to overcome them.

MONSTER COUNT: To make a correction to my review: Monsters 4 are the amount monster race edition gets (behemoth is purchasable or free if pre-ordered) and the 5th which monster race edition gets is still a mystery :o The hunter count is indeed 16 as of a few weeks ago and the 4th tier of hunters is quite fun and unique :D

FREE SKINS: Also, since this review was written, there has been 3 in-game weekend community challenges that awarded skins - all skins won by the community are given out regardless of whether or not you participated. Just as long as you play an online match on the weekends at least once. There has also been 3 hunter weapon skin events held on the android/iphone app. Those are ranked based and the skin you win goes to the game itself for use.

GRAPHICS ISSUE FIX: My R9 270 was bugged so I replaced with GTX 960 FTW and game is smooth as butter :D Even set pwoer target to 80% to keep temps below 70 and still has 50+ fps

QUESTIONS?: Leave a comment with questions and I'll answer best I can without holding punches for the sake of the game. I have 120+ hours under my belt already and I did grind out almost every hunter to elite status for personal testing and done a fair bit on the monsters.",Good Game and Unique FPS - Don't trust old Reviews or DLC ragers,1427155200,,"{'Edition:': ' PC Monster Race', 'Platform:': ' PC Online Game Code'}",

That said, Midnight Club 2 is not at all like its predecessor. For one thing, it's fun. The roadways are numerous and vast, and there are lots of little corners where shortcuts can be found. In addition, the scenery is much nicer - the cities where the game supposedly takes place are disturbingly similar to the real thing (I live in Hollywood). The amount of detail in the streets and that of the shops is incredible, considering that you don't have to get out of your car (in fact, you can't).
Overall, it's very close to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (fun-wise, graphics-wise, and pretty much overall) - you can go pretty much everywhere in the large, vast cities, but only in your car, and the graphics are quite a bit nicer than GTA.

Along with Gears of War it is an absolute must buy for any 360 owner regardless of genre preference. The grapics, gameplay, and storyline are all extremely tight.

That being said there are a few downsides but they are nearly all in comparison to the prior episode in the series, Morrowind. 1) The number of factions within the game is reduced. This naturally reduces the number of questions, storyline interactions, etc. 2) Between the various factions there isn't the same level of consequence. In certain quest of Morrowind, completing the quest either got you expelled from another faction or prevented you from join it. This added a more realistic feeling and made you get more creative in quest completions. 3) Training has been extremely limited. You're only limited to 10 total training levels per character level. This may just be me but I don't particularly like that.

The other two things are more personal preference. The ""level"" of enemies and items can go either way. I see why Bethesda did it but I liked the other way better. The other thing is a lack of multiplayer. I don't personally want a multiplayer aspect in this type of game but some people might.

Both of the expansion packs included with the GOTY edition are solid additions.  The Knights of the Nine starts out a little annoying as you go around making pilgrimages and such but it gets pretty good.  Shivering Isles is a solid edition worth playing on this and just to download from XBox Live if you already have the original version of Oblivion.

Again, overall a fantastic game. Definately a must buy.",A must have...,1208390400,2,,

In this game, players can do just about anything they want to do in real life, but can't thanks to those cops. The whole game is based on running missions for the mafia to take down rival gangs. You also need to steal a new car every few missions or so in order to run full speed. There are 73 missions, all running from several different mob bosses. The rival gangs are challenging and want you dead. In many of the missions, it is your job to take them down. They are also, however, looking to kill you, so watching your back is also a key part. Being wanted can cause a pain, with cops on your tail, but it is lots of fun to smash their cars with the tank! (NOTE: a code is required to get the tank.)

You can also stand back-to-back and shoot in both directions, if you want to. If you are a parent with a child under 17, DO NOT let them purchase this game. There is an excessive amount of vulgarity and violence. For those of you that are older than 17, enjoy the game! Although you have an arsenal of a large number of guns, there is more puzzles than shooting. The puzzles are harder than you can imagine, and as much of a pro gamer as I am, een I cannot figure out these puzzels. If you have played Resident Evil 1, and you know about crimson heads, in Resident Evil 0 there are no crimson heads. SHEESH! At least they could do something nice for you! There is only one zombie I dispise. That zombie is the leech zombie. They are practically invincible, and when you do kill them, (after about twenty shots with a shotgun), they fall apart into leeches, who jump on you and suck the blood from your body, and if you don't kill them, they will form another leech zombie!!!UUURRRRGH!!!!! Also, the main character, Rebecca, is killed extremely easily by just about anything, and sometimes, you are FORCED to send Rebecca on solo missions.

I was actually able to wear them for abour 3 hours straight playing Overwatch with my friends the other evening. There was not one point in which I needed to take off the headphones due to discomfort.

The second thing I wanted to talk about was the sound quality provided by the headphones. Both the sounds of the game and the voices of my friends came through clearly. The basses are deep and the trebles are crisp and high, and I was overall very pleased with the sound produced. I am a stickler for sound quality, so I can pretty confidently say that if I am happy you probably will be too.

The build seems fine. They aren't made out of concrete, so be aware that you probably don't want to try to bend things in a way that they weren't intended to. The mic swings down to be next to your mouth, and can easily move right back up if you want it out of your way. The cord is nice and long and splits into a mic out and a sound out at the end. But in the box an adapter is included so it plugs right into your Xbox One S controller. On the cord is a little piece that lets you control volume, or mute the microphone.

Overall these have been a very good purchase for the money. I've actually started using them to play games even when I am not using the microphone to talk to friends. I find it to be immersive when playing, and the wife does not have to listen to all the screaming and guns blazing.

It looked and played just like the original PS1 versions of Grand Theft Auto, only in portable form. So, when i heard they were coming out with Liberty City Stories for the PSP, I'll admit..I was a bit skeptical that they'd do a game like GTA3 justice on the handheld(especially after Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition). Yet, after getting Liberty City Stories, I must say I'm simply amazed at what Rockstar did with the game. Load times, which were my biggest concern, were minimal. The game looks and plays like GTA3(and future iterations of it) and, in some ways, one ups it. While it takes place in Liberty City(a town we all are intimately familiar with), the missions and storyline are all new. Multiplayer modes are new and fresh for the series. After three games like this, for the PS2, I thought I'd be burned out playing yet another game but, after playing the handheld version, I became more immersed into the GTA mythos. It being a handheld version added a whole new dimension to things. Sure, controls were a bit odd since there is only one analog stick among a few other lil nitpickey things about the game. Make no mistake, though, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is the Definitive PSP game that everyone should add to their PSP game collection.

In my opinion, games on the PSP have been no more than PS1 games with a PS2 graphical shine(not that it's a bad thing)...that is til this game came out. Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is a game that proves just what the Playstation Portable is truly capable of and is a game that all other PSP games should strive to match. If developers strived to match what Liberty City Stories accomplishes, just think of what type of games we could see on the system. Portable versions of Tony Hawks' American Wasteland, True Crime, Gun, or Call of Duty, perhaps? How about Champions of Norrath, or Final Fantasy? Only time will tell.

If you are getting a PS4 or an Xbox One, it is worth waiting so you can get better graphics and 64-player online combat (as opposed to 24 on the current-gen consoles). However, if you are not getting a next-gen console at launch, and would prefer to wait until you buy one (like me), then Battlefield 4 is still a must-buy, regardless of the player count.

Other people reviewing this game often skip over the campaign altogether, insisting that Battlefield has always been an online focused experience. While I definitely agree, I feel that the entire product needs to be taken into account. With that said, I played through the entirety of Battlefield 4's campaign. But how good is it?

CAMPAIGN
The story of Battlefield 4 is pretty good. Without giving too much away, I found myself caring for the characters. DICE has done a MUCH  better job with character development here than they did with Battlefield 3. While the overall plot isn't amazing, the voice-acting is superb throughout, and I felt constantly connected with the characters. I was genuinely surprised at the effort DICE put into the story and characters. However, I felt that the endings, no matter which one you chose (yes, there are multiple endings), were a bit sudden, and didn't have enough emotional weight to them. However, everything else story-wise is great, so it doesn't matter too much.

On the gameplay side, many people have complained that the game is too linear. I disagree. One of my biggest complaints with Battlefield 3's campaign was that there was absolutely NO freedom to play how you wanted. In Battlefield 4, you can choose how exactly you want to clear the room full of enemies. There are no people with ""follow"" markers above their heads. While you don't have complete freedom in every part of the campaign, there are numerous opportunities for stealth, sniping, close-quarters assaults, and more. For example, I ran into a hangar, with at least 20 enemies. When I played it the first time, I tried to be stealthy. I took out four enemies from behind with my knife before I was discovered. I then began killing as many as I could with my SCAR-H, before I was taken out by a sniper. Next time, I went to a weapon crate (crates where you can choose between weapons you have either picked up or unlocked through playing single-player), picked out a .50 cal sniper rifle, and began picking the enemies off one by one from a vantage point. After killing as many as I could, I ran downstairs and mopped up the rest with my assault rifle.

There are some light squad mechanics as well. Press R2 while aiming at a group of enemies, and they will be designated for the squad to kill. While designating a squad of enemies for your squad to kill, while you kill the others, can be cool, it's not a very deep system. It is almost easier to just kill all the enemies yourself, and save your squad the trouble. However, this isn't as much an issue as it is an unnecessary mechanic.

The campaign is not very long, taking the average player 5-6 hours to complete. A veteran can probably beat the game in even less time. However, unlike in Battlefield 3, where there was no reason to replay the campaign at all, Battlefield 4's campaign has more replay value. In every mission there are bronze, silver, and gold ribbons to earn for earning a certain amount of experience in the mission. However, in my first playthrough of the campaign, I managed to earn gold ribbons on every mission without really trying. But there are still many trophies to earn (if you care anything about that) and collectibles. Since the campaign is so fun to play, it is worth playing more than once, not only for the thrill, but for choosing a different ending, and to marvel at the awesome set-piece moments once more.

MULTIPLAYER
Before stating my opinion on the multiplayer in Battlefield 4, note that I am playing on a PS3, and not a PC. This means that this review is based on the 24 player multiplayer experience, as opposed to the 64 player online experience available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. If you have purchased the game on PC, refer to that version for a more accurate review.

Where do I even start? Battlefield 4 multiplayer is the same fun and addictive online experience that was available in Battlefield 3, but with more maps, weapons, modes, and the all-new Levolution system that allows for a lot of ""HOLY S#@%!!"" moments.

Yes, this game is awesome.

If you were a big fan of Battlefield 3 like I was, then everything will seem familiar to you in your first match of Battlefield 4. My first game was a game of Conquest on Flood Zone. Everything, from the gunplay and the classes seemed familiar. I was in the middle of an intense battle for a flag, when I looked down the street, and saw the water level rising. Since I was on a rooftop, all of the enemies were stuck swimming in the water from the flood. Me and my teammates were able to kill them and take the flag for our team. With moments like these, players have the opportunity to drastically change the level. Whether you're watching a skyscraper collapse in Siege of Shanghai, or a massive ship ram into the shore in Paracel Storm, the new Levolution mechanic can often make matches unpredictable and exciting to play.

There are two new modes available in Battlefield 4 -- Obliteration and Defuse. In Obliteration, two teams battle over a bomb. This bomb must be armed at one of the enemies three bases, resulting in a massive explosion. Each team has to blow up all three bases to win. This mode is easily one of the most action-packed game modes in the game. Matches often have all 24 players battling over the bomb at once, which results in absolute chaos. Once the bomb carrier picks up the bomb, everyone on the pother team can see exactly where he is at all times, which can result in quite the adrenaline rush if you are carrying the bomb.

The other mode is Defuse. If you have played Counter-Strike's Demolition mode, or Call of Duty's Search and Destroy mode, then you will be familiar with Defuse. It is a 5 vs. 5, close-quarters game where death is permanent -- no respawning. The attacking team must either destroy one of two of the enemies bomb sites, or kill off the enemy team. While this mode can be fun every once in a while, I didn't quite get the Battlefield vibe that I get when I play the other modes. However, fans of a mode where skill is paramount to success should thoroughly enjoy it.

I do have one problem with the multiplayer, however. Rush on a few of the maps in particular can make one team slightly overpowered, making it very hard to defend or attack the objectives. For example, in Operation Locker, my team easily armed the two objectives at the first base. However, when we moved up to the next base, we discovered that the only way to get to the bomb sites is to force our way through heavily defended chokepoints. Attacking teams rarely make it past this base, and if they do, it only happens 1 out of 5 times, making Rush games on this map very short. However, besides that, there isn't anything else wrong with the game.

Graphically, the game looks fantastic. While many players have been complaining about them, I can't really see much of a problem. While there is an obvious dip in quality between PC and PS3, the only way you would notice is if you played the two versions side-by-side. In my opinion, the graphics are still great on current-gen consoles.

Battlefield 4 is a consistently entertaining experience. The campaign is a fantastic diversion from the multiplayer, and the multiplayer is consistently fun and addictive, with an endless supply of unlocks to earn for each of the classes, resulting in nearly endless replay value. I would definitely recommend buying the game for the PC, PS4, or Xbox One, rather than the current-gen consoles. However, the game, regardless of platform, is still ridiculously fun. PS3 and Xbox 360 owners, don't worry -- the game is well-worth buying for current-gen if you have no other options.

That's all great and fine, but Nintendo took a brave, new step in this ""next-gen"" world and made gameplay into something completely different. Unlike Sony and Microsoft, it dared think outside the box, literally and metaphorically, transforming gameplay into something completely different.

For a while, I was worried that the Wii would disappoint, especially this whole motion-sensor feature. Sometimes you see something on an ad and you think it's like a McDonald's commercial where you unwrap the product and find it a tad different from what the ad suggested. Well, after having tried it out at home, I can say it's everything I thought it would be.

The motion-sensor works SEAMLESSLY. It wasn't clumsy, or weird, or clunky in any way. Granted, I haven't tried all the games I ordered, just Zelda, and played with the system a little, but I must say I'm impressed.

Now this mouse says it only works with windows but it actually has a really awesome feature that makes it perfect for a mac.

This allows you to plug the mouse into a windows PC, use the software to set up you macros, sensitivity, and pretty much any preferences and then simply move it to you Mac and all the settings stick. Not all mice allow this and many require you to use their software continuously.

Give this game a chance! After the first level and getting comfortable with the controls I quickly became interested in the plot. Why is some guy filming me killing people? The gangs I was hunting got much smarter so in killing them I had to become more devious. This game sucks you in (DEFINITELY PLAY IT IN THE DARK!!).

- Amazing gameplay
- Great characters and depth
- Very satisfying
- Remarkable online experience

Cons:
- Excruciatingly difficult
- Final Boss is unbalanced
- Trial mode is far too difficult

Gameplay:
If you're one of the millions of people that have played a fighting game then you know what Street Fighter is all about. Capcom's Street Fighter series has been marveled as the most widely successful fighting game series to date. Among the more than half-dozen Street Fighter games that have come out, nearly all of them have been highly competitive and have been the highlight of many international tournaments. The secret to the recipe is the overall balance, depth and sheer difficulty of the games. With that said, this next-generation installment of the series has been highly anticipated for quite some time, and thankfully it doesn't disappoint.

Unlike many other fighting games, Street Fighter IV is very combo-based. Button-mashing proves unsuccessful while speed and timing are absolutely necessary to win. The game sports a large cast of characters with all kinds of different unique abilities ranging from the defensive such as M. Bison, to the more offensive fighters like Akuma. Street Fighter IV includes several game modes that range from a typical arcade mode to a challenge mode that has dozens of very difficult challenges that reward you with unlockables. The arcade mode begins with an introduction the character of your choosing and sends you on a journey to fight different fighters around the world, and you eventually fight your biggest rival as well as the final boss. Subsequently, characters as well as videos and online titles are unlocked by just about everything you complete which makes this a very rewarding experience.

Controls:
Any fighting games controls can either make or break the game. Thankfully, Street Fighter IV has very quick and responsive controls which at times suck you into the gameplay. Each character has several special abilities which all require special inputs that take a lot of practice to master, and many experts recommend buying a fighting stick if you want to compete with the best. With that said, the PS3 controller's D-Pad work perfectly fine but with intense play your thumb will throb with pain due to the technicality of the game.

Graphics:
Thankfully, Capcom went with a 3D cell-shaded design for the game which came out looking amazing. The game is played on a 2D plane as seen in the previous titles but all of the graphics are rendered in 3D. Overall, the game looks great and the quality of the series has been preserved but given a very welcomed facelift.

Sound:
The music for Street Fighter IV is good but not great. On the other hand the sound effects are very well done and the unique sound of the series has remained the same. Also, both Japanese and English voiceovers have been included and both are absolutely top-notch.

Replay Value:
The story-mode can be beaten within about 30 minutes but that's only the beginning. Challenge mode has trial, survival and time modes which all have both normal and hard modes. Each challenge mode rewards you with unlocks as you progress. Also, there are more than half-a-dozen unlockable characters which take a lot of time to unlock, and all of them are very interesting. To top that off is a full-fledged online mode which features titles and icons to deck out your profile. The online mode is great addition and probably one of the best online fighting experiences to date. Overall, you're looking at over 60-100 hours of play time before you might feel like you've done everything, and that's assuming you practice enough to be able to complete the toughest objectives.

5.0,True,"02 22, 2010",A14A4AVU0N13UZ,B00269DXXO,Gust of Wind,"Originally released for Gamecube, Resident Evil (also known as REmake) comes to the Wii console without any major additions but is still incredible and worth every penny.

Using the ""classic"" format of the older RE games (pre-RE4 style), this is the definitive version.  RE2 may have had more jump scares, but this game has much more suspense and of course superior graphics.  Even today this game impresses with it's lushly detailed pre-rendered backgrounds and high-polygon character models.  Chris & Jill never looked so good, and in fact I prefer how they look here compared to their new RE5 designs.  This game is pure survival horror, so if you tire of the more action based game play of RE4/5 then get this game ASAP.

In terms of visuals and in game extras, it's exactly the same deal as with the GC game.  While it would have been nice to get a wide screen mode, the game can be stretched to fit your screen by setting the Wii settings to 4:3 and fiddling with your HDTV options.  The game doesn't look bad this way, but given the choice I prefer the 4:3 aspect.  It would have been cool if Capcom had used the extra space from the borders to display the map/items or health meter during game play.  This way the game would retain it's proper aspect but still take advantage of the extra space from the wide-screen TV.

Despite being on the bare bones side, this port does include one major visual improvement over the Gamecube version;http://www.amazon.com/review/edit-review 480p progressive scan mode.  I admit this was the main reason why I picked up this port since I already own the GC version.  In 480p, the game looks much sharper on my CRT HDTV.  I also tried this mode through VGA on my PC monitor, and wow beautiful stuff.  Even if it might seem like a small visual improvement, adding 480p to the package is worthwhile for those audio/visual enthusiasts out there.

In terms of controls, the game allows you with the option to use the Wii remote only, remote/nunchuk combo, classic controller and finally Gamecube pad.  Currently I'm trying to finish the game using the classic controller and it offers a fresh experience.  In short, REmake vets who want to try out different control setups have a good variety to choose from here, as well as the original GC controls.

And I should also point out there is no need to swap discs anymore either unlike the GC version which was spread across 2 discs.  This makes speedruns a bit less annoying and it just feels nicer to have the entire game on one disc.

Overall I'm satisfied with this port of Resident Evil.  It could have been a whole lot more, with new puzzles and features, but with the addition of 480p and new control setups, it's still a satisfying re-releases.",The Defining Survival Horror Classic,1266796800,15,,

so far, I had a chance to play an hour of campaign and the rest couple of hours I tried the Multi Player

Campaign : Decent story plot so far (watch out for the last scene of first mission), very well designed characters and a brief intro about them. The game play is smooth, shows us around with the new movement controls. You can also create your own class for each of the mission that you enter. with the weapons that most suit you, more like a pre lobby.
Pretty much like a test to feel the movement of the game and the controls.

Multi player : this is what Call of duty is all about, and they have not failed us this time. The lobby's were empty as I got an early copy (couple of hours).Could only play couple of decent games. Should look out to see if my game play is on any YouTube videos, coz there were few famous you tubers in there.
The game play is smooth. The abilities like wall run and under water abilities where beautifully designed. The transition from on foot combat to these abilities where very smooth.
Pros:
The footsteps were more louder and clearer to spot the enemies, unlike in AW.
I didn't have to empty a whole mag to take down an enemy, Couple of good shots were good enough.
No annoying exo jumps, which means snipers can have a big role in all the games.
Bo3 lets player choose different class of players with unique abilities. This is a bonus I would say to the already added movement system.
Cons:
(Will update, if found any)

This game would definitely bring back a lot of players from old gen consoles, which AW couldn't
If you are into multi player, then this is the game for you, else watch a few campaign game plays on YouTube and decide (I am not sure how long the campaign is).

The boss battle music isn't too bad, and I especially loved the intro music to when you have to beat all 4 levels of Mr. X (who is really Dr. Wily in disguise).  Although it was great to see Dr. Wily finally get his comeuppance by going to jail, it didn't last.  He would later break out of prison in Mega Man 7 (the graphics are not so great on the Super NES, by the way).

This particular series is waaay fun but much too easy; however, the Capcom designers more than made up for that with the Mega Man X, Mega Man Battle Network, and Mega Man Zero series.  One thing is for sure, no matter how many Mega Man titles are created, it STILL isn't enough!  :)  That is how great the entire series is, so what are you waiting for?

Secondly the graphics are amazing, this world based on heavy metal album covers it's fantastic so much eye-candy it's unreal.  You just want to drive around so you don't miss anything, every corner you come around it's like ""hay look at that!""

Third the game play is great, smooth combat I love how they mixed the melee with the guitar magic mid range attacks fracking original.  And the solo system is smooth and not cumbersome.  Three main game formats here solo combat, driving, and real time strategy.  All done well, melee is smooth, driving is a bit tricky in this landscape but well worth mastering because the Duce rocks, real time strategy here is a fairly simple system some people will want more control but were talking band members, bouncers, and head-bangers here not well trained military units it works and keeps with the spirit of the game.

As for the length sure if you go from main mission to main mission one after the other, and power game it, this game is short with the dialog and storyline the length fits. No this game is not epic sized like Oblivion but you can complete Oblivion in less than 10 hours if you simply power game it.

This game has so many new innovations that it's surprising that the release didn't get pushed back even further. The graphics are so beautiful and take full advantage of the PS3 in every regard. The music soundtrack and storyline are good too.

The best part of this game and something that can't be done on any other game system is the real time air battles and ground battles that take place simultaniously. The cell processor is the only hardware that can handle this type of extreme gaming.

The controls to the game are very smooth. Once the user gets used to using six axis (It took me about 15 to 20 minutes to stop using the joysticks every now and then lol) the game goes to an entirely new level. The camera is flawless, the cutscenes are great, and the fighting controls are great. The coolest part about airbattle is takedown when you can defeat an enemby dragon in 50 different ways and all are cool and a treat to watch and play through.

The boss battles in the game are tough enough to make the player look for strategy and yet they aren't easy to where the user will never die like in the new Zelda game for the Wii (Not to say that is bad, just that it is too easy).

The game challenges the player and also forces the player to replay a level in order to get a higher score (bronze, silver, or gold). The game isn't as long as other games, but the gameplay is soooo fun that this is completely made up for. I got about 6 to 8 hours out of the game (about the same as Rainbow Six: Vegas).

This is a must buy for all gamers who love the PS3, dragons, old time battles, and strategy, all along with beautiful graphics and flawless design.

Don't judge the game just because of a control setting. It was advertised this way and a player shouldn't buy it if they aren't into motion control.

With the number of places selling out constantly of this game & controller (balance board) package, I have to admit I was more than curious as to why but skeptical that it could be THAT good.  In my mind, there was no way that a ""fitness"" game could be that successful.

I have to say that we are not disappointed.  When I say ""we"" that is not just my wife, and myself, but my 15, 8 and 7 year old boys too.  Especially the 7 year old who's unlocked the most games so far due to how much he really does enjoy it.  So even though its good for you, Nintendo has successfully created the long sought-after combination of fun and healthy activity for a console system.  For that, I applaud them!

Specifically, what I like and do not like about the wii fit:

First of all, the activities are interesting, and varied.  The fact that as you do more activities, the more games you unlock is a motivator that keeps you going.  The varying types of exercising is great.  I have to admit, I'm not super macho guy but never been real keen on doing ""yoga"".  Just never interested me.  I found myself going through several of the yoga techniques on the wii fit, the other night just because this game makes it interesting enough to try it at least once, and after going through it, I'm glad I did.  I will be doing more. I won't go into the other games, but suffice to say that they all serve a purpose, and even the ones that seem more fun, still have a specific exercise in mind.

The BMI tracker is great, though I've never tracked mine closely I believe it does a good job and is effective, watching the way my wife enjoys this section.  I do have to cringe at the wii fit age though!  Since it says mine is +7 years! :(

I was going to put down some negatives to be balanced in my review. I'll be honest with you, there may be some but they are so miniscule to me, that I find them unnecessary to point out.

I really like the idea of going all-digital for many reasons, like 1. don't have to take extra time to shuffle around game cards if you want to switch out games when you're on the go, 2. don't have to find space to carry all the extra cards when traveling, 3. environmentally friendly, 4. load times seem to be more forgiving with some titles, and 5. with some patience, I have largely been able to find digital sales for games that well exceed physical sale prices.

I had been juggling two 8g cards since the launch of the Vita Slim (pain in the culo), and since that time I have saved so much money on digital sales, I decided to grab a 64g card. Shortly after, I was gifted a one-year PS+ subscription, and am stoked to have this card now for the IGL as well as for the PSP and PSOne library titles. I have 41 games on this card and still have over 25g to spare.

I would also say that for the current price of a 32g card, it made more sense to me to pay the little bit extra for the 64g card. So, something else to think about there, because I don't think I'll be hurting for space any time soon.

I haven't had any issues at all with this card and transferring data or recognizing content. The shipping was very fast (much faster than the estimated time by weeks).

The ONLY cons of this whole game are the difficulty, lack of Autobot choices, and the fact it's based on Armada. I was hoping for old school characters, but this game still rocks.

The Minicons add a great deal to the gamplay. Having to carefully select your special weapons is a blast. The graphics and landscape are phenominal. People moan about ""sluggish controls"", but if you remember the fact you car controlling heavy robots, it makes perfect sense. It's called inertia people, look into it.

There are two gameplay options: Freeform games and Challenges/scenarios. In the freeform games you can build the zoo the way you want to, from a choice of areas. You can choose an animal and put in in an exhibit. Then you've got to make the exhibit suitable for the animal. There are lots of animals to choose from and you can also download more from the internet (within the game).
In the challenges, you've got to meet the criteria within a time limit (for example a 12 month period) and if you complete it you get access to more challenges.
There are lots of ways in which you can make your zoo attractive for the guests, by building scenery and also attractions such as Elephant Rides, Avaries and Compost Buildings!

Although Splinter Cell is a very good game, I would say that Hitman 2 is actually more enjoyable.  This is probably because Hitman 2 offers a greater degree of freedom; you're given a target and a couple of guns at the start of each mission, but how you complete it is entirely your own decision.  You could go in with guns blazing or play the entire mission without killing anyone but the target, all of which greatly increases the game's replayability.  The graphics are also beautiful, with some of the best textures and water effects I've ever seen in an Xbox game.  On the negative side, the story is a little recycled (save the world from a terrorist with a nuclear weapon AGAIN) and a couple of the missions are almost ridiculously hard due to poor AI (as in overly paranoid guards or disguises that don't work no matter what).

Plants vs. Zombies is an arcade style game starring, well, a bunch of plants that do battle against zombies who want to cross through your lawn and into your front door to chomp on you.  Each plant (selected by you) has a special skill such as shooting peas, setting off a [cherry] bomb, or setting an entire row of lawn on fire like the fiery jalapeno does.  Ai yi yi!  Each time you complete a level, you discover a new plant with a special new ability you didn't have in the past.  Unfortunately, you are only limited to a certain number of plants you can take with you to battle so you must choose carefully.  To make matters worse, the zombies keep coming back even stronger.  Soon you'll be taking on Zombie Elvis and his backup dancers while defending against zombies who've jumped into your swimming pool.

The concept sounds cheesy, and it is, but it provides just enough of a challenge to keep you entertained for hours.  It's not extremely difficult, kids should be able to take to the game easily (and likely beat you at it) and parents need not be worried about gore as it's only cartoon violence.

5.0,False,"11 1, 2015",A3V7F58M4ZXHIF,B00RKK15H0,Night Lord 40K,"This game has proven to be a very controversial game, some love it, some hate it, some are middle road. I am on the LOVE it side of things, yes there are some unanswered questions in the game, yes there isn't the character development you might want, BUT if you play through the game slowly, listen to the squad banter while playing and pay attention to the cut scenes you will see the excellent story that 343 has crafted. You could blow through the game in quick order and at the end think, dang what happened and I was a little like that until I began playing the game on Legendary, playing very slowly ( because that's the only way to survive on Legendary difficulty ), and really started listening to what was being said by each squad member.

I know some people have no idea where the Master Chiefs team members ( Kelly , Linda & Frederick ) came from since you have always known the Master Chief as the lone hero. The game expects you to already know the background of these people and why they are important to the Chief also why they respect him so much to just follow him blindly into danger against orders. This is a fault in the game but not a big enough one for me to detract a star. Yes, I have read the books and know the back story on all the characters, and I was super excited to find out that these beloved members of Blue Team were going to be in the game, and I still am. For the typical person that has not read the books I urge you to either read the book ( The Fall of Reach ) or at least read a wiki about Blue Team and its members. This game is just a set up for more to come and no doubt deeper character development in future installments that we all know is coming.

Story : Like I said above, the game has a great story that you need to play through slowly, and pay attention to what is said by all characters, this series began with Halo 4 and is being called a saga this time, because they won't be stopping with a trilogy like Halo 1 - 3. The game does have a cliff hanger ending, like halo 2 left us hanging out there, but just like Halo 2 it is a set up for the next installment, and this only makes me want Halo 6 that much more.

Graphics : This is an absolutely beautiful game, there is no question of that. details galore all through out the campaign, it is an absolute visual feast to behold. Just like the previous games before it, the game is bursting with color and detail.

Sound : from the sound of auto rifles firing, explosion of plasma grenades detonating, ghosts zipping by or to the growl and screech of the scorpion tank as it moves around, everything sounds fantastic and gives you the feeling of just rightness, it gives you the sense that if the things in the game were real they would sound just like they do in the game. The sounds are just spot on.

Voice Acting : Absolutely wonderful, all voice acting in this game is worthy of a AAA movie. Some games focus more on gameplay and not so much on cut scenes and the voice overs for the characters in the game, but Halo 5 nails it with superb voice acting and gameplay. The one character that has been complained about the most though is Spartan Locke. I actually had no problems with him because you can tell they went for the go by the book, follow every rule. very professional type of soldier Locke is, so to me it fits his character . I do think we will see him loosen up and fall inline with the Chief as the series progresses, so "" I think "" we will see his character loosen up and loose the rigidness he has now.

Gameplay : You just couldn't have asked for better gameplay, it's locked at 60 frames per second and runs buttery smooth without texture pop in, hitching or lag. The game also has a progressive resolution system that scales down the resolution during high intensive sections in the game, this allows the game to keep a flawless frame rate, and to the eye you will never see the difference in resolution as the majority of the game will run at full 1080 p and only dip occasionally to approximately 900 p or better. The controls on the game pad have change a bit but they were to accommodate some of the new Spartan abilities that have been added to the game, and you will find yourself getting used to them fairly quickly. Halo still feels like Halo, make no mistake about that. Although movement is faster and new abilities have been added, it still retains the beloved Halo feel, I actually think the movement system in the newer games ( Reach, Halo 4 & 5 ) are a welcome addition and the biggest to me is the sprint ability, as much as I LOVE Halo 1 - 3 the only thing I MIGHT have changed about them is the ability to sprint.

Multiplayer : This multiplayer just might be the best in the series. Everything seems well balanced and just all together right. Everyone starts out evenly matched and no one ever seems indestructible, giving everyone a chance to get the kills or complete the objective set forth to help their team reach victory. This is one of the things that made Halo great, amazing campaign and outstanding award winning multiplayer, and I can confirm the multiplayer goodness is back with many different game types, some old and some new ( the classic type matches are still intact like Slayer, team Slayer, Swat etc etc etc ) . the game launched with 20 maps and we will be receiving 15 maps for FREE during the first year. They have added a type of micro transaction element to the game that lets you buy REQ packs that allow you to receive random weapons, equipment and skins during gameplay in the two Warzone modes. These micro transactions were put into place to help off set the cost of developing DLC for the game since they didn't charge a fee for all future content, which I give them a standing applause for that because I absolutely HATE buying map packs ( I'm looking at you Call of Duty with your 50 buck season pass ). Some have given this game one or two stars because of the micro transactions and I'm sorry but that is just the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. The REQ packs don't do enough for the people that buy them to make any real difference and you can't use the packs till near the end of the game anyway, so the players that didn't buy them will have earned enough points to get them in game without ever spending a dime of their real money. The option is there for you to spend your hard earned cash if you want, or not, I won't because it's just not worth it to me when I can get it in game, BUT some people will and I say let them because all they are doing is supporting the game and future content. Besides that, like I said before I LOVE 343 for giving us all future map packs and expansions for free and not charging nearly the full price of the game for a season pass..

Conclusion : This is a GREAT game, it has the full package that includes Great gameplay, story and the award-winning multiplayer that we have come to love and expect in the Halo franchise. I would highly recommend this game to anyone, Halo fan or not, there is much love to be had with here..

Half-life 2 has physics never seen in a viedo game. Any object light weighted can be used to throw or gather to use to help slove nifty puzzles and missions. You can move almost any object to cause chain reactions of movement and style. You will be traped with the almost real characters and life like physics.

The story will really keep you playing, to find out the next little bit of whats going on. At the begging of half-life 2 you don't no whats going on so the game traps you to try to find out. There are no Cut-Scenes, you live the cut-scenes you can move around while learning whats going on. Half-life 2 is a gore fest of fun, and is like War of the worlds on a disk.

Some games have been completely pathetic, while others have been relatively good. I bought Tiger Woods 09 for the Wii basically because I like to try most every golf game that hits the market. My expectations for this game were actually fairly low, as EA has not exactly put out killer software for the Wii.

Having put in over 30 hours with Tiger Woods 09 I can safely say that this is the most fun console golf game I have ever played. Not only is the game incredibly deep with an absolute ton of modes of play, but it also sports a great online component. The developers really did a good job of making TW09 a truly fun multi-player experience.

What makes Tiger Woods 09 such a great game is the control. The 1:1 swing mechanic can be tuned in a variety of ways. It takes some getting used to in terms of shot strength, but once the user gets it down the game is butter. As far as putting is concerned, this is the best putting system in a golf game, no questions asked. Yes, the putting system may seem confusing at first, but after spending some time with it the user will realize that putting in TW09 is as close to real-life putting yet seen in a golf game. Everything from the clearly visible slope on the greens to the depth of resources the putting system provides to the user makes hanging out on the green a joy.

As to be expected, the graphics of the Wii version of Tiger Woods 09 are not as detailed as those of the 360/PS3 versions, but they are still not too shabby. I particularly like the way the undulations and elevation changes on each hole are depicted.

Finally, EA smartly included an ""All-Play"" level of difficulty that allows inexperienced or less-skilled gamers to be able to be competitive. Of course, there are standard and advanced difficuly levels as well. This allows someone who has never played the game or is not very good to be able to play with a seasoned TW pro and still have fun without being blown out of the water. I like to play on the hardest difficulty level, but when someone comes over to the house they still have fun since they can play on the easier mode.

Overall, Tiger Woods 09 is exactly the type of sports game Wii owners deserve. It wonderfully takes advantage of the controller technology, offers a ton of modes of play and customizations, and has a high fun factor. Get this game and spend some time learning to play it properly. You will not be sorry.",Best Console Golf Game,1223424000,31,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

There's not many Wii titles that I pick up these days most of it being due to the fact that the system is so kiddy-ish these days. It's hard to find a good mature title. I remember reading about this game eon's before the Wii was released. So when it came out I knew that I had to give it a try.

I only saw a few screen shots and read some reviews on the game but I hardly pay attention to what paid reviewers say. I had to judge the game for myself. My first time playing the game I wasn't so into the style of it. I was thrown into the game without understanding what was going on. I pressed some buttons swung the Wii remote around and but the game back in the case. I just wasn't taken away by it.

Some time later I found the game again and decided to give it another try. This time I stuck with it. When I got to the first boss, I then realized just how amazing this game was. The fighting was unbelievably intense! I hadn't experienced combat like this. It really got me interested in the game.

Now I'll be honest about No More Heroes. The game isn't exactly polished. There are obvious areas of the game that needed more attention like vehicle controls, and the environment. However, that is just a small part of the game and can be easily over looked. This entire game is about the Bosses! and oh my! They are incredible. There seems to be so much more going on to them that isn't spoken, but it's like you get to learn everything about them by the way they fight. The Shinobu battle was one of my favorite and I fell inlove with her style (very glad she will be in the sequel).

The game pretty much goes like this. You do side quest to earn money for the next fight entry, you ""warm up"" for the battle by fighting mobs of enemies,then you go and fight the boss. It's pretty simple enough. No more heroes is pretty much a fighting game thrown into an ""action adventure"" format. It works extremely well, but people that compare this game to others like GTA etc. don't understand what this game is supposed to be about.

The bosses in No more heroes have alot of character and are probably some of the most interesting I have faced in all 20+ years of gaming. It's like after you defeat one assassin you can't wait to see what the other will be like.

My only issue with No More Heroes is that it feels incomplete. The story even though interesting just seems like it could have more depth and development to it. The game just feels like something is missing. It's well crafted, but it's just missing that ""shine"" to it. Another thing about the game is that it's also semi challenging. The ""warm up"" battles are pretty straight forward, but the bosses can be rediculously hard, or rediculously simple, it all depends on how quickly you can adjust to their fighting style.

After you fight Shinobu, you quickly learn what you need to do to beat the game, as she forces you to actually fight her logically rather than just mashing buttons and hoping for the best. Not many developers can pull of melee combat that forces you to think and study your opponent. It's what really makes this game.

Just to also note, I've read lots of reviews where people talk about the art style of the game. You can't really mention No more Heroes without talking about it's visuals. The game is crafted well, and the semi-realistic art style fits right into it. The facial expressions, personalities, and overall theme of the game can't be accomplished without it. It reminds me a lot of the old Playstation ""Fear Effect"" games. It's just absolutely great.

Overall this is a great Wii game to own if your a mature player. Don't really recommend for people under 17.",This game is lacks polishing and it's still a mind blower!,1260921600,2,,

5.0,True,"03 9, 2016",A3VP62H2WAP20N,B014LNTVGK,Willie G.R.,"Wow, where to begin with this game?  Well, this game has THE most beautiful graphics of any Wii U game.  There is more than enough content to satisfy any intense J-RPG player.  The character customization, aside from the few limits imposed in the western version, has a pretty large selection for making your character your own.  There are more than enough missions and side-quests to keep you coming back for more and more and more, there are also many characters to have in your party, but you need to finish their first quests before you can get the choice of having them join you.  The world you are in is HUGE, and all 5 continents are a world of their own, plus, weather effects can really change the way you play, so you won't get bored any time soon.
The Art Book in this Special Edition is BEAUTIFUL, and full of detailed drawings of all the characters and locations you will find in the game, the special art is pretty neat to have, and the USB with the music, though small and limited in content, as well as having the music protected (this can be worked around so you can extract your soundtrack to play outside your computer) is pretty neat to have.  It looks like the Life Hold pieces, and it lights up blue when you plug it into an USB port.
The game's drawbacks?  As always, there will be some drawbacks for any great game, and for this one, I would say some musics in the game are pretty lame (like the music playing in the city at night), there are so many characters, that though you can see some character development, it sometimes feels rushed for some of them, though it's not so bad.  The main story is pretty interesting, but you'll be more drawn by the exploration than the story itself, and then there's the issue with the Data Packs you can download to help the game load faster for you.  These are optional, and work to help the game load a little faster, but they take up a LOT of your precious little Wii U Disk space, and if you, like me, don't have an external hard drive, you'll need to clear up the console's space to get it in to work.","Fantastic game with lots to do, and beautiful graphics to enhance your experience.",1457481600,,{'Platform:': ' Wii U - Special Edition'},

Not gonna go in full detail about the game, there are plenty of reviews about that, but i will mention some other important things about the game.
1) As of late i noticed an unfortunate trend with latest games: you get a cool game with latest graphics but the game lasts 12 hours on average and you are done. It took me over a week to beat this game; and let me tell you what a ride that was!
2) Touching little more on that trend again, latest games often lack quality and good story to them (with few exceptions of course, but as a general rule). Witcher 3 has the greatest, breathtaking story i have ever seen! Up to this point, Mass Effect 3 (with added improved ending) had this honor, but Witcher 3 beats it hands down. Extremely innovative story; sometimes i thought i knew how things will turn out in the end (i am pretty good at it), but boy i was in for a surprise.
3) A lot of games have this quest trend: clone questing. Same thing over and over, go there, fetch that, get this. Witcher 3 has numerous quests that are all very different, with surprising twists all the time and are a pleasure to complete, not a chore like in other games.
4) Choices! Choices, we all love them, it makes us feel like we matter and we can affect our gaming universe. Well, ladies and gents, look no further than Witcher 3. Love, sex, war, murder, and much more, serious, mature decisions that will truly touch your heart; sometimes things will make you angry, some things will make you sad, and sometimes you might even cry. That's how good the story is!
5) Last, but not least graphics and combat! How good is it? Pretty darn good if you ask me. Graphics are amazing, not very often in the game i stop in the middle of somewhere just to enjoy the view (i think it looks almost like real life). Combat system is amazing, so much gore for those who enjoy blood and guts. You can dismember, decapitate, and do other nasty thing with those who did you wrong.

Final word, this game is not for kids, but adults will be able to enjoy this game to its fullest. Finally a game that doesn't care as much about money as much as satisfying it's customers. A lot of games out there sacrifice quality for profits. For example in order to gain the most people to play the game, companies don't include much sex, gore or other stuff in the game, so that youngsters could play it too, sacrificing potential of the game. Well, Witcher 3 is made specifically for adults with everything you could possibly wish for included in the game.

Do you get the bang for your buck buying Witcher 3? Absolutely! I even think that it's worth more than $60. As a matter of fact i can't even remember last time when i was so satisfied with a game. I am not big on writing reviews, but i was so impressed with the game that i felt compelled to give it 5 stars on Amazon. A word of advice, do yourself a favor and buy Witcher 1 and Witcher 2 too, and play them before playing Witcher 3. There are so many deals right now, that you can buy them for very cheap. Witcher 1 can be difficult to play at first due to crappy graphics, but story will get interesting after 1st act :) If you are thinking about buying this game, do yourself a favor and buy it, you won't be dissapointed!",Three words: Best Game Ever!,1434585600,4,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

That in and of itself is a pretty cool idea and for those interested in playing a real instrument makes this a step up from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-Band-2/dp/B001BX6JUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock Band 2</a>.

Yet simple ideas are also the easiest to botch.

They don't botch this one. Rocksmith is essentially a guitar teacher in a box, walking beginners through all the basic concepts while also providing experienced guitar players with a fun way to learn how to play the included songs. A simple tutorial gets folks up and running. Experienced Rock Band players will need a song or two to adjust to the slightly different visuals, but once that clicks you're off and running.

The very best feature is how the games adjusts to your experience. I am a more experienced guitar player than my son, for instance, so it didn't take long before it was asking me to play note-for-note covers of The Rolling Stones, The Black Keys, Silversun Pickups, and more. He's newer at the guitar, and the game automatically adjusted to that, giving him more stripped down versions that still had him playing along but in an ""only the basics"" kind of way.

The game is a little more challenging than your standard music rhythm game. If you've never held a guitar this might not be the best place to start. However, even newbies to the guitar should catch on pretty fast -- and they might even benefit.

In addition to the usual shtick of playing through a career and unlocking all sorts of guitar gear, the game also provided a slew of mini games, many of which are essentially guitar practice sessions to help you master various techniques.

Rocksmith falls into the category of music rhythm games, yes, but it's an evolution of the genre, providing players a great blend of gaming and actual musicianship. A great bridge between playing games and playing instruments. I love it.",This. Is. AWESOME,1326844800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Dante has returned and , although I didn't think it was possible, he's even more bad... than ever! Plus, there's a new character joining Dante in this new adventure; her name is Lucia (and ooohhhh baby she's caliente!) The only downside though is that Dantes' old sidekick demons, Alastor and Ifrit, are not around this time, but Dante does have a new devil form of his own and so does Lucia. The game also has an enhanced Devil Trigger (I'll let you find out about it yourself when you play the game). Oh yeah, there's one other thing: Trish from the previous game is not around either, and neither is Dante's old sword Force Edge.
But, at least Dante does have a new sword called Rebellion (and later in the game you get two more swords that serve special purposes). However, Dante does have his two twin pistols Ebony and Ivory, and later he acquires a new shotgun, missile launcher, and two sub-machine guns. Lucia also gets her own new weapons, but I won't spoil it for you. The story is better this time around, with more frequent cut-scenes with amazing graphics (don't worry though, they're not really long like in the Metal Gear Solid games). There are new demons to face off against- some of the enemies though aren't demons at all; even some of the old demons from the previous game appear to challenge our two heroes: Sargassos, Blades, and the Phantom. Oh boy, and wait 'till you see the final boss: it's crazy!

Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is on par with Sucker Punch's Sly Cooper and even surpasses it in some ways.

Most of Thieves in Time focuses on Sly and his ancestors, who all play similarly to Sly with their own little mechanics that differentiate them. Some of the time is spent with Bentley and Murray, though they're certainly not the main focus here. Bentley is a lot of fun, offering good platforming mechanics and solid old school shoot 'em up mini-games for hacking. Murray, though, is certainly the weakest aspect of Thieves in Time, offering brawler, beat 'em up levels that don't really add much to the game. But honestly, Murray's bits are a very small part of the overall game, which, I might add, is an excellent platforming game that any Vita owner should play.

The graphics are obviously cartoony with a comic book aesthetic, but the whole thing is very detailed with great lighting, art direction, animations, etc. It's a visual package that's entirely cohesive and charming throughout. This is one of the best looking Vita games.

Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is a win for the Vita, as it's a great portable version of the home console game. Sanzaru has shown that they're clearly very skilled at making games, and all of their hard work and dedication is shown in this great game. I hope Sony lets Sanzaru work on more of their games in the future.

5.0,False,"12 23, 2008",A3D91ARVPUEKHP,B000X1PE16,Dennis Grube,"Simply put, Dead Space is frighteningly fantastic!  I haven't been this tweaked by a horror game since Doom 3 for the Xbox and F.E.A.R.  You literally never know when or where something is going to come at you!  Sometimes the game would even throw random sounds (like a large metal pipe hitting the ground and clattering around somewhere in the dark distance) just to mess with you!  I would be creeping around completely paranoid cause i heard a sound and there would be nothing .... NOTHING! ... then as soon as i start to relax ... a ""quarantine"" or something similar would go into effect, the room would lock down and i would be set upon by a swarm of enemies of same or varying types!  O.K. enough of my general exuberations :P ... on to the facts:

Pros:
-Environment: the levels were largely unique and you even revisited the same ones on different missions.  This fact matters little, however, due to the fact that even revisited levels would sometimes be ""changed"" in some way as well as throw newer or different enemies at you than the first time you ventured through.  I don't think there was a single moment in the entire game that i felt ""safe"" or ""secure"".  The permanently set ""creepy ambience"" was integrated into the game wonderfully!  I've never looked over my shoulder so many times in a game and been so paraniod about every corner and shadow :P.

-Enemy design: I'll admit that while the enemies did not have a plethora of variation, they were varied enough to keep it more than interesting the entire play through.  I feel that there were just enough different enemies to keep you on your toes.  Meaning, when you encountered a foe, because there weren't a WHOLE lot of different ones, you had just enough time to evaluate the TYPE of enemy it was and determine how to engage it without too much deliberation.  Therefore strategy played a part in your combat experience but it did not dominated it, giving you a ""fight by the seat of your pants"" feeling.

-Combat: As a person that primarily plays First-person-shooters, adapting to the 3rd person (Metal Gear Solid) type of gameplay took a little getting used to.  However, once I got the hang of it, i must say i like it just as much as an FPS style game.  The controls are simple and easy to use as far as aiming, shooting, melee, and switching weapons is involved.  Even if an enemy does get the best of you, you can usually button spam to get them off and lay down the hurt on them for crossing your path.  Collision detection was phenominal(!) both in normal gravity and ZeroG.  Dead enemies and objects reacted in a realistic way when kicked or thrown.  Even live enemies knocked aside their dead comrades as they charged forward to rend your head from your body; which in some cases where the lighting was bad, could be enough warning to help you spot some of the smaller aliens.  The weapons were interesting as well.  Most of them had a slicing or cutting type of fire, and they all had a secondary firing mode.  My personal favorite was the pistol type plasma cutter (first gun you get in the game) and the assault rifle which would hold a 200 round clip when upgraded (very good for those long fights with lots of enemies .. who needs to reload?).  And while you found a decent amount of ammo laying around and could buy additional supplies from the ""Store"", it was very possible to run out of ammo while trying to make it from one cache to the next.  I came close several times but never actually depleted my supply.  And i'm a ""conservative shooter"" lol.  The fact that your ammo takes up inventory slots that you have a limited number of makes it all that more challenging. (Tip: upgrade your suit as fast as you can :P) Those inventory slots are like plutonium to Stewie Griffin ... the more you have the more destruction you can rain down upon your enemies :P.

-Controls: i mentioned it a little bit in the ""combat"" section but as far as controls go; they take some getting used to at first, but once you do it feels pretty seamless.  I was actually pretty intimidated when i entered a ZeroG room for the first time.  Not only did it mean i was going to be able to go ANYWHERE in the room but also that the ENEMIES could come from anywhere also :P.  I also thought it would be hard to maneuver in ZeroG, but it was as simple as ""point and click"".  It was just as easy to stand on the ceiling and blast the baddies as it was on solid ground.  And i'm not sure if it applies but i'm gonna put it in this section anyway.  No HUD!  Zero.  Nada.  None.  Your health is located on the spinal part of your suit, your ammo counter pops up for the amount remaining in the current ammo clip for whatever weapon you have equipped when you AIM with it, and as far as your inventory goes, you can move around while you're sorting through things and it follows where your character is LOOKING, it doesn't just come up flat on the screen, it turns with you!  Overall, it's a very smooth, very sleek and very tight configuration of data.  Once you get familiar with what each type of ammo looks like it only takes a quick glance at your inventory screen to see if u should switch weapons soon or fire away blindly into the hordes of corpse-spawned enemies.  One quick, final note i have on controls is that i like the fact you can run in pretty much any direction, strafing and moving backward included.  It definitely helps keep u mobile while keeping your enemies in your sights.

-Story: You might think a scary game wouldn't have too much of a back story to it.  Just throw some poor helpless fools into a scary/creepy environment; spawn some demonic/alien/mutated baddies; and let the screaming, flesh-rending, horror commence.  Well while it DOES have all that, Dead Space also has a pretty decent storyline.  I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but I will say that things defintely aren't what they seem (cliche i know but it fits :P).  In addition, there were at least THREE times i thought the game was over (or about to be over), when instead some random twist of fate threw me right back into the mix!  Keep in mind i'm not complaining in the least ... but i will say when i DID actually finish the game it FELT like an accomplishment :P.

Cons:
-Boss Fights:  The boss fights for the most part were straightforward and simplistic ... save one.  And while it kept the game going with minimal frustration, i feel as though they could have made them SLIGHTLY more complex without hindering progression.  Other than the lack of strategy to boss fights though, they were big and epic feeling for the most part. ^_^

-Space Ship Gun minigame: At two different points in the game you will take command of an anti-asteroid laser defense system.  The first of which you are actually defending the ship against incoming asteroids.  This event was by far the single worst part of the entire game.  The aiming controls and actual targeting were simply atrocious.  When i first sat down at the controls and the viewport openned to the vastness of space and i looked at the enormous rounds of ammo on either side of the double barrel monstrosity that was an anti-asteroid cannon; all i could think was .... ""Hurry up and throw some rocks at me!!! I'ma gonna blast the HECK out of em!"" ... after three failed attempts and scraping by with only 5% hull integrity the final time all i could think was .... ""OMG i hope i never have to shoot that thing again!""  While i DID have to shoot it again the second time was not NEARLY as painful.  But overall this event was a relatively small stain on the stylish Armani sweater that is Dead Space.

Final comments:
Something i didn't mention was the vacuum events.  The muffled sounds of your weapon discharging and the faint, almost non-existent wails of your alien pray as you sliced your way through their attacks in the cold vacuum of space, felt so real it made me want to hold MY breath lol.

Overal this game gets a big 5 out of 5 stars.  Now if you'll excuse me i'm going to play through again with all the unlocks and continue to upgrade my arsenal :P.",What was that sound? ... oh it was just the game screwing with me ...,1229990400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"05 1, 2016",A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B0053BCML6,T. Skylar,"Animal Crossing was what I'd describe as a sleeper hit when it first came out on the Gamecube. The game warranted enough attention to have further additions on the Wii and Wii U and portable with the DS and 3DS. The cute characters and childlike graphics would have you thinking this game is for children when it's really accessible to all ages. There's a real innocence quality to Animal Crossing, but make no mistake it's not exactly child's play.

In New Leaf you move into a new town as the only human around anthropomorphic animals. When you arrive everyone mistakes you for the new mayor and decide that surely  you must be the mayor. The citizens trust you to serve them and with handling day to day town activities. You're given shelter and a mortgage, let your new life begin!

You'll be doing plenty of fishing, catching bugs, searching for fossils and fruits. These activities occupy a lot of your time, it's by doing them that money (bells) will come. You'll then be able to pay off your mortgage and move into another, bigger, better house with a heftier mortgage, of course. The mayoral part of the game is fun as well, if not challenging. Conducting ordinances, expanding, developing, building, creating, and maintaining citizen satisfaction is easier said than done. How much or little time you devote to these activities is completely up to you.

The translation from home console to portable was already well executed with Animal Crossing Wild World for the Nintendo DS. If you ask me, New Leafs builds on what it's DS counterpart does and exceeds it in every way. The 3DS version is beautifully simplistic with that trademark bright coloured Nintendo-style graphics. The portable experience is massively satisfying and provides most of what the home console versions do. I somehow always end up curled up with my 3DS and New Leaf.

It wasn't made with hardcore gamers in mind, but it's very addictive. Rather, Animal Crossing is a game that you play at your leisure. You find yourself constantly wanting to upgrade your house, the stores, developing your town. It all takes time and patience. For these reasons, Animal Crossing won't be for everybody (especially if one lacks patience). It is best played casually, here and there everyday than in large chunks of time otherwise it might get a little redundant.

Animal Crossing deviates from the norm by being a game focused on normal, everyday activities and interactions instead of shooters and sci-fi-inspired titles that are all the rage today.

One of my favourite aspects of New Leaf is the customization. From the way you look and dress to how you decorate your house and the items you can purchase, the customization opportunities are ever present.  Naming your town, nicknames, putting items up for sale on the flea market, building bridges and infrastructures around town... It goes on and on. Going for a new haircut, shopping for clothes and new furniture sounds tame, but believe me when l say these little things are exciting and part of the experience of Animal Crossing.

The habitants will always differ from city to city. Perhaps your friend will have a dragon living in his town and you'll have a horse instead. Even when you start over and begin a new town or get a new habitant in your town, it really is the luck of the draw. It keeps it interesting and fresh. There are also different types of characters with their own quirks and behaviors which adds to the fun. They often want you to get them fruit or do tasks such as deliveries which can sometimes get a little repetitive. I wish the habitants offered a wider range of tasks and challenges.

You can also catch a boat to Tortimer lsland which is a lot of fun. The island has different species of fish and bugs, that are all the more valuable. With these, you can complete the museum's collection. The museum? Yep, there's more to the game than you realize. Buying from and selling items to Re-Tail and Nook's Junction for instance. It's fairly easy to understand the game, pick it up amd plag right away whether you're a veteran or a newbie.

Animal Crossing mirrors real life. If it's winter, there will be snow. Likewise if it's 10:30 A.M. where you live, it will also be the time in New Leaf. The stores have day hours and will close after a certain hour, adding a touch of reality to the game. If it's night in realtime, it will also be night in the game.

I played the original Animal Crossing on the Nintendo Gamecube and loved it. It's with confidence that l say it remains every bit the enjoyable experience it ever was. I've had New Leaf for almost 3 years and l keep going back to it. Every so often l'll restart my town and rebuild my town from scratch. It's always fun to try to achieve your perfect town. New Leaf is incredibly satisfying if you have an itch for a portable Animal Crossing or if it's your first time playing. Fun or children and adult alike and at the risk of repeating myselfaddictive!","Cute, charming and addictive!",1462060800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,True,"06 20, 2007",APOUYO1BEPK22,B000FNH6OK,M. B Cole,"If you ever want to play a new Diablo... I HIGHLY recommend Titan Quest. The game is a lot of fun if you like Diablo and D2. When I first started playing it, I was thinking to myself 'eh...it's aight'. After I stopped paying attention to the story line and just started hacking and slashing, I began to really love the game. If you loved the itemazation of D2, then you'll love it here. Seriously the game is Diablo 3.

I think the biggest things I like about this game compared to D2 is that everything that aggravated me about D2 was fixed in this game. It's like THQ read the Diablo forums and it's own forums to fix what the customers wanted. The game was made to be FUN and not to aggravating. For instance...when a yellow or higher item drops..you don't have to Identify it with a scroll. You can use it right away if your requirements are right. Speaking of scrolls, you don't have to use teleport scrolls. You can teleport ANYTIME you want to. So say hello to more bag space! Also remember when you were building a character in Diablo and you realized you made a horrible mistake while going up the tree...causing you to start ALL OVER? No more! You can pay to fix you stats now. Plus you can have 2 talent trees instead of just one. So you can have a Warrior with Rogue abilities...meaning you'll be an Assassin. Or what about a Warrior that can cast spells...yay now you're a Battlemage.

Some people have been saying the gfx aren't that great, but compared to the only games I've ever played that are like this (D and D2), the gfx are VERY pretty. I like how the grass moves around when you running through a field and how the water leaves ripples behind it when you are running through it. This by the way is with my gfx turned ALL the way down. I can only imagine what this would like like on my home computer.

That's the downside and only really bad one I've come to notice so far. This game, for some reason, needs a pretty good computer to run it. I'm using my laptop to play this game since I'm in Iraq and thats all I have. My specs are AMD Turion 64 X2 Mobile Technology Tl-52 1.60 Gig1 gig of Ram, Nvidia GeForce Go 6150. So it's not that great of a lap top for games, but it can still run this one even though I have some big slow down issues somtimes especially when it's night in the game. STILL though, I'm having a good time with this game.

I'm really happy I bought this game. I figured it would be crap since I've not played just a straight hack and slash game since D2. To me other games just never could get the one thing down that I loved about D2. The items. I was a Mephisto, Pindlesking, Bael running FIEND back in the day. I loved to see the what crazy new items I would get and HOPEFULLY it would have the BEST stats of that item. Well the same thing is in Titan Quest. Rares, Epics, Set Items... they are all here. Even with stat variations.

I'm a happy magic finder! Dang I love this game.

Her passion for video games is this, when I play she goes shopping.  For the first time in our marriage we have played a game together, and not just once but for hours.  Rock Band brings people together.  It has brought out a side of my wife that I never knew exisisted...I thought she would mumble thru the song as a singer, I was wrong she warmed up with loud HELLO BOSTON (the venue we were in) and than did her best Axle Rose impression.  Than she played drums and it was like sitting next to Animal from the muppets.  Needless to say we had fun.  For the first time since we have lived in our new house we have asked people to come over to complete ""The Band"".

Ok I love the game but what else.  First the instruments are constructed well enough and I have faith they will last.  The microphone is heavy enough to make you believe you are holding a real one.  The drums seem to hold up to a beating.  I feel safe in saying that they will hold up to our future performances.  The song list is the best set that I have seen and I compared it to Guitar Hero before we made the purchase.  Some of the songs are hard to mimic and should be left to the pros but they did cause us to laugh when we attempted them.

Ease of game, we had no problems and like I said from the start my wife is not a game player and she was able to pick it up the first try.  Future challanges, the harder your level the more realistic the game so I don't really see anyone getting bored.

For those who wish to relive the old days when Games were sold as finished products, and if you enjoy the good old days when the creative assembly and Sega gave a damn about these games then this game if for you.

I have to say, it is a HUGE improvement on the original. Things that were difficult, annoying, or troublesome about the first game have been improved or outright eliminated in this version, like making it more clear how to obtain rare items, and reducing the overall cost of building the enormous repertoire of outfits and variations of those outfits that the game offers. I like to tell people this game is very similar to Animal Crossing, which it is, but I feel it actually has more to offer with the combat element of the ""episodes"" where you can fight ghosts, and if you're a Disney fan, plenty to unlock and explore. I think kids will be interested in seeing the characters and collecting the fashion outfits, and adults will really enjoy the intense collecting and achievement hunting aspects. My only regret is not being able to get the preorder bonus outfits, but new special content will be added each month for free through the game's website with QR codes, so I have that to look forward to.

You'll definitely want to play this a second time through, choosing paths opposite to the ones you initially chose in the first round.  The best thing to do is to keep a written log of all the critical choices you made (which are shown at the end of each episode, or in the game menu itself), and then do the opposite when you start a new game.  For example, I chose to make Bigby hit or kill everybody and act very mean and aggressive.  The second time, I'll have him be nice and diplomatic while not hitting or killing people.

5.0,False,"10 15, 2013",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00EZPCX1A,Tsanche,"For those who have followed Nintendo Handhelds, the very idea that they'd release so many different versions of one handheld is nothing new.  The original Gameboy eventually had the Gameboy Pocket and then Gameboy Color.  The Gameboy Advance had the SP and the Micro.  The DS had the original release, the lite, the DSi and the DSi XL.  The 3DS already has the original and the XL.  It seemed strange that so soon after the launch of the 3DS XL we'd find ourselves with another DS release.  This is the 2DS.  On the outside it doesn't seem like much, but once you get it in your hand it's actually pretty solid.

As a note before beginning: The following review assumes you are quite familiar with the 3DS already.  In reading this I am assuming you are familiar with the 3DS interface and features.  They will not be detailed here.  Just know that they all work exactly the same here.

There are only two major differences between a 2DS and 3DS.  The first is that there is no stereoscopic 3D.  This means those hoping to play their games in stereoscopic 3D won't be able to do it.  For someone like me who insists on playing his original 3DS with the 3D slider turned off anyway, this is no problem.  It doesn't bother me in the slightest.  The second major difference is that the screen doesn't close like other DS models.  Other DS models had a clamshell design that allowed you to fold the screen down.  Both screen are visible at all times.  If you plan on getting this for a child I would strongly suggest buying screen protectors.

Aside from those two things, the 2DS pretty much does everything your 3DS does.  All the channels are still there.  You can still access the Nintendo eShop.  There's nothing really ""stripped"" away here.  There is still a place for your SD card on the side.  All games are inserted into a slot that's on the top of the 3DS.  The camera still works just fine.  The interface is still fine.  The stylus is located in a slot on the back about halfway down the right hand side.  Anything you could do on your other 3DS systems you can do here.  It also retains being able to play your original DS games, although it doesn't look like there's a chance of it playing GBA games for those who are wondering.

For those curious about the size of the 2DS, it's relatively small.  The screen sizes are that of the original 3DS and not of the XL.  So you won't have to worry that it's ""too big"" for the little ones.  Although the DS itself might be a tad small if you've got big hands.  Other differences include the fact that the L and R buttons are a lot bigger and easier to press.  The button placement itself actually works.  The face buttons (A, B, X, and Y) and circle pad are located next to the top screen while the directional pad is located closer to the bottom screen.  The start and select button are also located near the bottom screen off to the side just below the face buttons.  They're all very easy to get to and because it's not too big it's perfect placement.  Also, and I must say this is especially nice, there is a switch that allows you to put the 2DS into sleep mode.  Since you can't fold the top screen down they built in this little switch to compensate for that.  Just a flick and your 2DS goes to sleep.  A flick back and it wakes up.  Perfect if you need to put it away for any reason.

There are only a couple of gripes with the 2DS.  None of them large.  The first is that I think I'd have preferred a clam shell design.  The 2DS is quite a remarkable device.  Yet a fold down top screen would've still been nice to have.  That way you could easily stick it in your pocket and not have to worry too much about scratches on the screen.  Both screens could've been protected this way.  This is pretty minor, but something that would've been nice, nonetheless. The other thing is that if you are getting this to replace a 3DS or 3DSXL some accessories don't work.  Those who got a Circle Pad Pro, for instance, won't be able to use it here, for instance.  I'm sure there will be brand new accessories to go with it, but at this point it feels odd that Nintendo isn't simply making a model with a second circle pad always there.  Likewise, if you're actually getting this to replace your 3DS, Nintendo has made it very tedious to transfer your data.  As you must perform a system transfer.  So if, for any reason you plan on trading in your old 3DS for a 2DS for any reason, keep in mind that you need to do a system transfer before handing it off.  You can't simply pull out your SD Card and put it in another system.

This, of course, brings about the question always asked when a new model of a system comes out.  Is it worth it?  The answer varies from console to console.  But here I'll say simply that the 2DS is definitely a cheap alternative to the 3DS if you don't have one.  The price isn't bad.  This is especially nice if you have a young child.  If you've already got a 3DS there's no particular reason to get a 2DS.  It does all the same things.  The only reason to really replace a 3DS with this one is if you really like the design (or if you're looking for a cheap alternative should your need to be replaced).  Nevertheless it's not bad by any means.  As a cheap alternative it's perfect.",Much Better Than Expected.,1381795200,66,,

However, I just finished playing through it for the fifth or sixth time, and I thought that sustained enjoyment deserved some praise, however late.

This game was a surprise gift from a good friend of mine who knew that my favorite character to play in Diablo II was the Summoning Necromancer.  I'd had my fill of FPS stress at that time, and the Summoning Necromancer appealed to me because you are removed from the melee and take on the role of field general.  You direct your minions to do the dirty work while you stay back and cast spells to support them.  So much less clicking!!  My tired hands were very happy!

Overlord is a hybrid of the Necromancer character from Diablo II and the humor of the Dungeon Keeper series, and even though the character development is much simpler, the gameplay is varied without being tedious or frustrating.  I was pleased to discover that the game begins with a tutorial which is essential in getting a handle on wrangling your minions.  There are different ways to deploy your forces, and the tutorial doesn't cover them all, which is smart because it would be too much information up front to remember.  Transferring console controls to other platforms can be difficult, but Overlord adapts to the standard PC keyboard/mouse combo very well.  Only five minions are yours to command as you begin, but you add more as you defeat creatures and harvest their lifeforce.

Your goals in the beginning are not complicated, but grow more difficult as your minion numbers and your ability to summon different kinds of minions increases.  You start with five Browns which are your fighters.  Reds are impervious to flame and have a ranged fireball attack.  Greens are your ninjas, and when stationed at a guard post will turn invisible and then sneak attack when enemies come too close.  Finally, your Blues are your healers, and they are also the only minions impervious to magic.

Learning how to deploy each type of minion effectively is very straightforward, and the dungeon in your castle provides a perfect place to practice.  You can also battle the creatures you encounter in the game here to harvest further lifeforce.  At first, you'll want lifeforce just to be able to summon enough minions, but soon you'll want much more so that you can make armor and weapons.  One of the RGP elements of the game involves acquiring a series of smelters that allow you to forge better equipment.  Each item will require a certain amount of minion lifeforce, and this is where the ""grinding"" aspect of the game occurs.  The best armor and weapons need a LOT of minion lifeforce, so you will likely spend a LOT of time in the dungeon later in the game.

However, you can drastically reduce the length of this task if you purchase the Raising Hell expansion pack.  I would highly recommend it, as Raising Hell adds almost half again the content of the original game, and the new areas are very clever extensions on the story and characters.  The level design is beautiful, and the challenges are inventive.  There are also five new molds you can acquire for your smelter, and the Harvesting Helm should be the first one you make.  It doubles the amount of lifeforce you get, making grinding MUCH easier.  Thankfully, it is available about halfway through the game, so you will be able to make the best armor, helm and weapon for your character before you reach the hardest levels.

The voice acting in the game is unremarkable with the exception of your minion master.  This character has a good performer, for which you'll be very thankful as he has the most lines and talks to you through the entire game.  I enjoyed the babble from the minions, as the squeaky voices fit their limited brainpower.  Even after several complete runs of the game, I was still entertained by their incoherent chatter.

I would heartily endorse Overlord to anyone looking for a challenging yet fun gaming experience that has plenty of action while still providing some nice periods of calm exploration.  The game is easy to learn, fun to play and has good replay value due to the different tactics that are possible.","Easy to learn, challenging to play, and snarky humor.",1386460800,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

The replay value is sort of high, but it's not something I would dedicate much of your life to. True, you get cool powers associated with your choices and some different dialogue here and there...and civilians throwing rocks at you...but otherwise the game progresses quite nicely without having to go over it two or more times. Perhaps it's because of the decision making strategies these games implement. To choose the side of good or evil has become chronic in video games for quite some time now and it tends to get tedious. Aren't there anymore options other than saving citizens or letting them rot, sucking electric energy from downed foes (or innocents) or healing them and restraining them? Apparently not. Still, I can't help but love the game.

It's a combination of Crackdown, Spider-Man, Assassin's Creed (though when you fall into water it makes SENSE that you would die) and Fable. Cole McGrath, your playable main character who sounds a bit too much like Christian Bale in The Dark Knight, has been given a super special electric ability that provides him with the ability to save the city he currently resides in. You get a grand assortment of powers that are fun, easy to implement, and slightly diabolical. Collecting blast shards, unlike Assassin's Creed's flags, actually gives you more electrical energy so it becomes a quest and not an achievement (or in this case trophy) based hope. The game is by no means easy, especially when one makes it to the second and third sections of the city. Of course, that only seems because all of your enemies have just increased in health. The bosses being one of them. ...I have never been so happy to see a health bar diminish. Particularly on Hard mode. Speaking of that mode, I was expecting something a bit more insane other than just MORE enemies or MORE attacks. The movements of the enemies are absolutely similar to one another and you can predict motions like you can predict where the sun will rise in the morning. This makes it a bit boring to replay, as mentioned earlier. And...since it was on Hard mode, you just wind up attacking for longer periods of time, getting more frustrated than elated with the sudden and ever-present danger.

At the same time the game is creative, curiously interesting, and inviting. The story is not boring and it actually gives a bit more reason to the good/evil complex. It has a lovely comic book quality to it where there is mixed moments of action and subtle, emotional strain coupled with a cyclical nature. I wasn't bored with it the first time around, only the second and even then it wasn't like I didn't want to play it. It's compelling enough to make you want to play it, only wishing for something slightly more complex than simply more enemies. You have an entire city to explore and run around in causing ruckus or healing. Most PS3 exclusive games turn out to be duds, but this is not one of them.

Also the button reaction on this is the quickest I have seen with those big bulky ones the reaction is very bad and sometimes the analogs don't work properly.

The graphics are spectacular, the voice work is great and the story is engaging. Yes, the combat is a little repetitive, but no more-so than most games out there. Also, the developers did a nice job of breaking up the combat by adding in scenes where you lead legions in formation, control artillery fire or use ranged spear attacks. No, this isn't a Game of the Year candidate, but it's still a solid game.

The major shortcoming of Ryse actually isn't the gameplay, but the fact that it's fairly short--probably around 8-10 hours to complete the single player campaign.

The story is a mix between the original black and white along with new things added. If you played black and white,and you didn't like it(like me)then play white 2 and black 2. They have SO MUCH TO DO!!!!

Black and white were awful games. The story and  pokemon were terrible. Thankfully,white 2 and black 2 came out. When I played the games,I LOVED IT!!!! What a great game. I played black 2 for like 116 hours!!!! Why? BECAUSE ITS AWESOME!!!! If your a gamer or pokemon fan,this game will satisfy you.

So,what's so amazing about this game. Well,you know In black and white all the game really had were dumb unava workmanlike the candle pokemon(yes,candle). And puppy pokemon. In the squeals,old pokemon are able to be obtained. Pokemon like pysduck,riolu,eveve,absol,marepp,and many more!!!! Old pokemon really made fans happy. Also,two new forms are made for kyream. Black form and white form. These forms made the pokemon's stats better. New lendendary pokemon too. Latios and latais,depending on the game. The three regies can also be obtained. Zora,the fox-like pokemon can be obtained without an event. A new team plasma who is after kyream. New towns and dungeons. And a battle area in the city with the ground type gym leader. With to it there is a battle area to battle gym leaders and pokemon trainers. That's ALOT of new things. There are a few more but find out by playing the game!!!!

There is no limit by leveling your pokemon. So,if you want super strong pokemon,go to the black tower in black city. There are different floors with different trainers. Some floors have stronger trainers then others. It's tough,but it's a great way to get strong pokemon.

One thing also amazing about this game is that you can make moives!!!! It's in the city with the second gym leader. There is a studio up north. There,you can act with rental and your pokemon!!!! It's cool to be famous for once....There are all sorts of moives to do. Making it a bunch of fun.

Pokemon white 2 and black 2 are one of the best pokemon games in history. Unava has changed so much over 2 years. And there are some good pokemon to raise. If you want a good team then chose either tepig or the otter pokemon.(I can't spell the name). A Dragon type like dragonite or flygon would be useful. A ground/rock type to. Maybe a flying type for speed. Well,you need a good team because there are many annoying trainers.

These games are epic and amazing and you should play them. Anyone who hated black and white will love these squeals. Pokemon white 2 and black 2 has a bunch of fun things so play it and enjoy!!!! Also,there is a few things that are changed with the old towns. But,you will find out!!!! Enjoy the game!!!!",A great squeal!!!!,1428537600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Just upgraded to 5 stars! Does it deserve it? Idk but I have grown to really love this game. Played 20 hours now and it's become addictive. Combat is timing/strategy more then button mashing. Now that ive learned the combat it is highly satisfying even when killing weak enemies. Exploring the world has become exciting. Every part feels unique and has something to discover. At night the moon is crazy huge and awesome to behold. The choice/consequence factors are done so well. I find myself wanting to revisit places/people just to see what may've changed. Its probably the most enjoyable open exploration Ive played in a while. Theres just something about the game that's compelling. Think fallout, the witcher, dragon age, and mass effect but it has a uniqueness thats all its own. Forget the trivial negativities that some reviews talk about. This game just simply isn't tailored for everyone. All games have little annoyances and this one definitely has some, but if you can be patient at the beginning and learn how the game plays its really quite fun and worth it. Originally gave 3 stars then 4 and now 5 is my final rating.... A game doesnt have to be tripleA to be great.

Initial Review:
I highly recommend you customize the combat settings after you start new game. The Combat takes some getting used to. It can be frustrating and overly difficult, but you can customize specific combat settings after starting a new game. This makes the combat work more in your favor. I was skeptical to buy because of negative reviews. I ended up watching game broadcasts on psn and found that most of the critical reviews regarding graphics, voice/dialog, and combat appeared to be inaccurate. You can adjust combat settings which makes the combat much more enjoyable. Graphics not top tier but really aren't bad at all. The world seems detailed and vibrant and looks pretty good. Character models appear crisp and detailed. Controls seem fairly smooth but sometimes can be a little ""clunky"". I was actually surprised at how smooth the camera control is. I believe my expectation was lowered because of bad reviews, but controls don't seem to be a bad issue at all. You can also adjust camera distance from your character. You can jump, climb, sprint, and fly with a jetpack. The jetpack works well and is fun to use to navigate around. Climbing a ladder for some reason is extremely slow but instead I just jetpack up there. You can literally jump/fall from just about anywhere and land safely with the jetpack. Voice/dialog seems to work just fine, but sometimes can sound kinda cheesy. Conversations are engaging and come with choices and consequences. You level up and distribute points to your attributes. You can learn skills/abilities. Equip all kinds of weapons, armor, acc, and use many other items. The only cons are graphics aren't top tier but still not bad at all. Combat can feel unbalanced and frustrating if you don't customize your combat settings. Overall the game is good and highly enjoyable. Im glad I didn't fully base my buying decision on negative reviews.

5.0,True,"05 23, 2012",AR7QWB86XJO82,B00178630A,HLB,"In my opinion, it's all good, which includes the fact that, aside from some relatively minor changes, Diablo III is essentially the same game as its predecessor. That's just fine--Diablo II was a smashing game, and so is D3. The classes are fun to play, if not altogether novel, as some of them combine elements of others we've seen--and enjoyed--before. The graphics are beautiful and atmospheric, and as may be expected these days, much less static than they were twelve years ago. I know some players lament the fact that you still can't pan the camera around freely, but let's face it, most RPGs that let you do this earned little more than complaints about ""awkward controls"" that hamper the action. The latter is something Blizzard certainly seems determined to avoid, and successfully I believe. Given the hordes of monsters D3 ceaselessly launches at you, would you really want to fiddle with the camera? For what it's worth, the Zoom function now truly zooms in on the graphics instead of merely enlarging the pixels as it did in the earlier games. And that's worth a lot, as the art design is elegant and original, and deserves a closer look. The biggest change is in the way your character's abilities are meted out. No more talent tree, forcing you to lock in your skills. The game decides what you get and at what level, depriving talent tinkerers of some of the flexibility they enjoyed in the earlier games. The advantage of this new system is that you can deploy all the different abilities you have acquired (along with their individual upgrades) at any point in the game. If this particular change doesn't profoundly disappoint you, you'll enjoy Diablo III as much as you did Diablo II, unless you played that one for so long that something of the mad joy of slaughtering legions of monsters and always chasing the next better piece of gear died in you years ago.

Let's not forget about the elephant in the room, of course. You need an active internet connection to play Diablo III. That's active as in ""active for the duration of the time you wish to play,"" not just for authentication. But frankly, the bumpy launch due to this feature notwithstanding, this doesn't bother me one bit. Sure, Diablo III is supposed to function as a single-player experience with online play as an optional feature, causing people to question the logic of requiring a constant Internet connection. But I believe that unless you really do not have Internet access during most of the time you intend on playing--in which case I would naturally recommend against your purchasing Diablo III--this is an academic point. If you're just angry at the fact that Blizzard ""went there,"" but could certainly play D3 with its Internet requirement, don't deprive yourself. Moreover, we should judge the game on its merit, not on what is required to play it. Many recreational activities have, or have added over time, certain entry requirements you need to meet to be able to participate: computer games require access to or ownership of a computer, to play golf you need to be able to afford membership in a club, and without cable or satellite, a lot of televised content will be unavailable to you whereas in the past, all you needed was a TV set and an antenna (so we should hate and boycott all those fancy new HBO programs). Blizzard is simply one of the first major players in the field of computer games that added a new entry requirement for the enjoyment of one of its products. It's a bit shocking, perhaps. But as the software sector gradually moves toward a world where you no longer own physical media but rather lease content, I doubt that they will be the last company to use this method to protect their revenue stream, no matter how busy you get trying to downgrade their ratings in forums like this one.",Addictive as always.,1337731200,5,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

Mercenaries is a 3rd person shooter thats packing more than just a cool subtitle, ""playground of destruction"", it literally is. Players will assume the roles of three different Mercenaries dropped into North Korea to take out ""the deck of 52"". This will be no easy task, yet a very rewarding one. Through accomplishing missions, whether by capturing your enemies or killing them, you'll earn points to buy new weapons, unlock secret players (Han Solo, Indiana Jones), and gain new abilities such as calling airstrikes. Mercenaries is a very lengthy game and will provide hours of entertainment, most of the time as you just blow the living crap out of everthing around you. But the game is deeper than that however, but you can take it as you please. For example, you can take on missions and earn money using helicopters, tanks, sports cars (every mission can be different every time) or you have the freedom to go on a rampage and make not only the citizens, but the factions, violently mad. The graphics in Mercenaries are awesome and seem a bit like Freedom Fighters mixed Star Wars Battlefront, as others have mentioned. They are awesome especially the explosions, particle effects, and ragdoll deaths. The sound is great and really gives off the feeling of a combat zone. This game is THE action title to own right now and unless you absolutley hate this type of game, you need to buy. Now, this game got a 9.1/10 from IGN and a 9/10 from PSM so its almost perfect and i give it a 10/10. People have compared Mercenaries to GTA but what game produced after GTA that involves cars, guns, and killing hasn't been compared to GTA, thats bound to happen. Its been compared to Socom...nah! Doesn't seem that way to me. It does seem alot like Freedom Fighters but on a way bigger scale. Just about the only thing that is lacking in this game is multiplayer. But that doesn't matter that much when you've got one of the greatest single player games on the PS2, but at least I've still got TimeSplitters 2 and Freedom Fighters for when I've got my friends over. So all in all, Mercenaries is one awesome game that will rock your PS2. Buy it if you are even the slightest bit entertained by action games. This is the ultimate action game.

But make no mistake, this is not a kid's game, or a bad game.  It is a very good game, very long, and I definitely feel like a got my money's worth, for sure.  I don't know why some commercial reviewers gave this a low score; I think sometimes they forget there are games that aren't Call of Duty; EA has pumped them so full of money, etc.

I'll break this review down into a few different areas:

First graphics:  This is definitely one of the most beautiful games to date.  I don't want to stereotype, but there's something these non-US developers do that, I guess accessing lower level processing (in programming terms), having higher math/algorithmic skills in general in other parts of the world, are able to crank out more than the others.  While Mark Cerny wrote and directed the game, he speaks Japanese, and worked with Sony's Japanese studio to develop the engine.  It looks and plays just like you're watching a PIXAR film on Blu-Ray, but, you're actually playing it... in real-time.  Along with Killzone: Shadow Fall, you can see where the added processing power of the PS4 allows for an insane amount of realtime particle effects, animation-like shaders (in this case), great realtime lighting, and super high resolution textures all at 1080P.  You can see the dimples in the characters' clothing; stuff like that.  It's got a very movie-like appearance and maintains it throughout the entire game (no dropping to low-res cutscenes where you can see the pixelation, etc, like on the old 360, where the DVD space limit limited the size of movie files, content, textures, etc).  Basically, it looks jaw-droppingly good.  The color is incredible, as well; that really stood out to me.

Gameplay:  There is a lot of good, and a bit of bad.  Basically, the plot is interesting and keeps the story going, and you're there to beat 'em up and occasionally solve puzzles; it's a platformer.  I think this is basically Sony's answer to (and a combination of) Mario, Crash Bandicoot, and Jak and Daxter, Katamari Damacy, with a touch of God of War; and that's pretty much how Mark Cerney expained the gameplay in various conferences.  So the core gameplay itself is solid, the platforming, the fighting (based around the right-stick-dodge/block maneuver), and puzzle solving.  I have only three complaints.  1) The hidden items-there are so many of these, you can never get them in one playthrough, and with the highly varied textures of the environment, ANYTHING and EVERYTHING looks like it could be a secret door.  Yet most of the time, it's not.  So you punch a lot for nothing.  They should have stuck with more known gamplay mechanics for the placement of hidden items so you wouldn't have to spend so much time punching through every single wall.  Of course, you could always just look online to find the places, but that's no fun.  2) The pieces/size thing kind of only makes sense half the time; sometimes you're just going to be small knack, sometimes you're giant knack.  You DO grow/shrink along with your health, but in some sections, it's not as much of a difference as one would expect.  3) It's great that they used the speaker on the PS4 controller for item pickup sounds; I just wish they would have used more of the buttons and the touchpad; these were wide open and available; only about a quarter of the controller was really in use throughout the game; kind of weird, but it works for a beat 'em up game.

Sound and everything else:  Great

My only closing issue is, after you've beaten the game, it says your items/gadgets/collectables have been saved and can be carried into a new game.  Yet, when you start a new game, you don't have them!  The only way to do it is to use the same save as the one you just beat, but that won't let you change the difficulty level, so you can't go back and beat it on hard with the same items after beating it on normal, same for ""very hard"" which opens up after you beat it on hard mode.  Kind of a bummer they overlooked this; it would mean huge replay value.  Probably it'll get fixed.

Overall, it was a great game, and one I would buy again if I had to do over again.  It was well worth it.  It kept me busy for quite a long time (it's not a short game), and always managed to add something new and interesting along the way, while challenging hand/eye coordination.  Well done!","Definitely Ushers In the ""Next-Generation"" of Gaming",1390262400,,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},

The Sims 2 is a huge upgrade over the original program (which was a very nicely done and very addicting piece of software)!!

1.  3D graphics are tremendous.  The level of detail from the woodgrain on the flooring to the lights and switches on the sound system!  Wow!  The graphics alone are worth the purchase, but make sure you have AT LEAST the minimum system requirements AND a compatible graphics card.

2.  ""Building"" your own Sim.  There are many more options for how your Sim looks - physically, attire, etc.  Bulbous nose, triple chins, beady eyes, studded denim, J. Crew-like sweaters, etc. - they're all there!

3.  Music - you can use your own .mp3 or .wav files for the music that comes out of the stereo systems that your Sims can purchase.

4.  Aspirations - you can assign a set of aspirations to your Sims.  They can aspire to gain large quantities of knowledge, popularity, money, etc.

5.  Geneology - the game allows you to establish a family tree, and offspring pick up the ""DNA"" of their parents!  Will they pick up the good qualities or the bad?  Definitely fun to see.

There are so many improvements that I could go on and on!

One important thing:  The interface has been updated, but it is very, very similar to the original's interface.  The learning curve is not steep for those who are familiar with the original, and it is very intuitive and easy to learn for ""newbies.""

Players can create just about any kind of character they desire.  For example, I created the following:

a.  2 overweight rich guys who see themselves as the world's greatest lovers.  It is hilarious to see beautiful women fall for these guys because of their money!

b.  A serious young man who becomes a doctor and marries a money-grubbing tramp.  He catches the tramp fooling around with his best friend, and divorces her.  Next, he finds an ""all-American"" girl, marries her, gets her pregnant, only to lose her in a kitchen accident.

Nothing short of phenominal. Blood, gore, detail, color,and even wrinkles(!).

Good story but could have been deeper. You are a nonotech creation created by the chancellor of the Commonwealth, Victor Sopot. You join the Red Faction after you realize what he has done. Your code name is Alias and along with four other nanotech soldiers you try to assassinate Sopot.
GAMEPLAY:
Fantastic. Responsive cotrols,dual weild, seperate firing, grenades, andthe ablities to swim,jump,and crouch your way to victory is as sweet as each kill you make. PlusGeo-Mod is back and better than ever beby!
MULTIPLAYER:
Sweet. That about sums it up. You can play against upt to 4 people matches or fight it out by yourself against up to six bots. You can also create up to six bots you fight against. You choose their weopon prefs, aggressiveness, camping tendancy, accuracy, health, damage multiplier, and agility.

So at first I felt it was kind of slow and that I was seeing the impact that I felt I was dishing out. You have stats for your fighter and while you might be amazing in real life your character needs to improve. It's not that he won't move with you perfectly, because he will, it's the fact that his hits won't be measured as a perfect punch. So you have to boost Strength, Speed, Stamina, and Technique to get him up to your level and beyond. That's just the beginning however. You also have Chin which allows you to take more hits and Heart which helps you get back up if you have been mowed over. Only bad part is you really can't move your feet as you will be told during the tutorial. The rest of you is fine, but they have you rooted to that spot and probably to stop people from getting out of the cameras view. Custom soundtrack is supported so you can abuse people to your favorite fight songs.

Finally you have career mode and training facilities to improve your fighter. Career mode is like the one person stand alone to get you used to the ups and downs while earning yourself a little bit of cash along the way. The money is used on clothing, healing (since broken bones make for a weak fighter), and training facilities. Training includes things like the tutorial which gets updates from time to time, a spar which is just for practice and doesn't give you anything, the large punching bag, the small up high punching bag, an accuracy test, and an endurance match. The last four I mentioned give you upgrade points that you can spend on boosts which I named earlier. I tend to use either the large punching bag and/or the accuracy test since I'm better at those, but in all fairness did not try the endurance match.

Almost forgot some really important things. There is a gauge that measures how good or evil you are in a sense. Fighting using straight up boxing techniques makes you a good guy and shows you as being respectful. Fighting using the dirty moves and/or cheating (i.e. buying the download content to improve your fighter) lowers your respect. Not sure what respect does yet, but my guess is increases the price of items such as shoes, jewelry, tattoos, and other clothing while also warning other players online this guy might have paid money to improve his stats. Improved stats does not equal ability since you still have to be able to move and punch with precision. No stat is going to make up for really horrible skills.

I also recommend a well lit room for the camera as you will not be able to use the head sync if the room is kind of dark. Trust me it's a lot better to be able to bob than holding the X button which makes fighting a pain.

As far as multi-player is concerned I have not yet tried it and not sure if I can even do so online yet. I can tell you the features include spectator, tournaments and betting. Betting also gives a percentage to the winner. If the person you bet on has won a lot of fights and therefore those who had bet on him previously won a lot of money, you get a percentage boost for that. You also get a percentage boost for betting on winners multiple times.

Now this brings me to the trophies. You want them and badly. Trophies offer stat boosts and unique abilities that cannot be gained by any other means. These include stamina speed rate up, easy dizzy and/or stun/stagger break, easier to stun/stagger or dizzy the opponent and many other skills that will greatly improve your character in later battles and I'm sure for online fights as well.

The disappointing side is the lack of options in character customization. I did not see any long hair styles and on top of that for females who play you cannot be a woman. I'm surprised since there are definitely some woman out there who are pretty beast and you wouldn't want to mess with them. I guess they don't want guys beating up on woman since it could create all sorts of unwanted issues, but for women who play the game it's going to feel a little off I'm sure.

All in all this is an amazing game and at less than average dollar value. It offers more than pretty much any boxing title out, but in fairness they only paid for one big representative versus a huge cast of sportsman faces that would sue daily if they didn't make a certain amount of money for the use of their likeness. As far as the Playstation Move controls are concerned those are really good as well. It matches everything you do. For those of you who know eastern martial arts the turning punch motion won't increase the damage in the game, but is still useful. Boxers can easily show off as well. Great buy, a lot of fun, and a push to keep you at it with the stat system. All the fury of a real fight with the lack of a real hospital bill.",1:1 is no joke.,1289347200,92,,

However, this Logitech G230 Stereo Gaming Headset fits wonderfully OVER the ears. Completely surrounding your earlobes in comfort and sound. The cushions are also removable and washable, which is a huge plus.

They sound fantastic and the microphone works wonderfully on our Teamspeak and Mumble servers.

So if you're looking for quality, actual over-the-ear, gaming headphones (With a mic that works nicely!); these are perfect and won't stretch the budget.

Year Update: 12/01/2015

These were purchased on November 27, 2014, so we've hit the year mark now and I thought I would update.

To this day, these remain the most comfortable pair of headphones that I've ever owned. The sound quality is still excellent and the microphone works perfectly. I've yet to experience any problems with this headset.

I attribute much of my enjoyment to the removable mesh ear cuffs, which I believe have helped immensely with the longevity. They are easily removed and cleaned, preventing the usual buildup you might have on most headsets. The mesh itself helps by being incredibly breathable, relieving me from the common issue of sweaty ears. Plus, since they're not covered with that slick ""leather"" stuff you usually find, they haven't suffered from breakdown or flaking apart as you find with other headsets.

As my wife says, I have a big head. These fit my large noggin without a problem and completely surround my ears, which was always a big factor for me in finding comfortable headphones.

Overall, these are more than worth the price. After a year of daily use and abuse, up to and including my beagle pulling them off my desk and head when she wants attention, they have held up without any visible wear and still work as well as the day I bought them. We paid $34.99 at the time and after the hundreds I've put into headphones over previous years, I can honestly say that these are well worth the cost.

I've not been paid in any way for my review. I'm just that happy with finding a headset that fits all of my needs and is super comfortable.",Still Great after 1 Year.,1417824000,,{'Style:': ' G230 Stereo'},

Pros
1. The story is completely amazing.  You're Earth's last hope to stop this mass genocide of galactic species.  No pressure huh...
2. The graphics and witty dialogue are outstanding as well.  The decision making help determines your future in this game and the next games to follow giving replay value an extra boost.
3. Saren reminds me of Sephiroth in a way.  He is controlled by alien that has destroyed many people over and over again.  This gave me the extra boost to take this sack of crap out.

Cons
1.  I was hoping for space battles with the geth, but you can't have everything you want I guess.

I bought it at EB Games for 40$ and it's WELL worth it. The game and controls and storyline and very different from anything you've played before, but it's very unique. The characters you can control are some of the coolest ever, and it seems almost like a graphic novel/film. To sum that up, it reminds you of Sin City, as the colors are mostly black and white with the splashes of red for blood and some yellow for the enemies weak spots.

The enemies are odd creatures that either stagger slowly towards you like zombies or run quickly like the ones from ""28 Days Later"". You have to press R to bring up your weapon and press L to scan them, as they are invisible. Scanning also displays their weak spots with a yellow dotted sparkle, and you quickly have to shoot at the spot to kill them in one shot. Killing them gives you blood, which you use to upgrade character skills, replentish health, etc.

You press A to walk, and the games guides you along rails, and you reach junctions, which lead you in opposite paths. Some players don't like this control, as it takes away the roaming aspect, but I personally think it's cool.

Killer 7 is a game a lot of people will hate, I had a friend borrow mine and give it back, saying it was gay and too strange.

I thought it was even too bizarre for me at first, but I instantly got hooked to it and did not want to stop playing, even after long periods of playing where usually you would get sick of the game you were playing.

The multiplayer aspect, which was already incredibly advanced on the N64, is going to fit in very well on the forthcoming Xbox version with Xbox Live. But it's the single player that always makes a game for me. The world that Conker inhabits is a bit like an 'adult' Alice in Wonderland, taking so many great twists and turns without ever seeming disjointed. There is a wonderful compactness to the game - there is never a sense that any space has been wasted- no interminable treks along featureless corridors- unlike Starfox Adventures, Rare's next console game.
Yet the game manages to provide a sense of scale typical of the greatest adventures- at one point you can look down at the great expanse below from the edge of a diving board.
This game was the last of a string of fine platformers on the N64 and my favourite- more so than the unforgiving Mario 64.
An integral part of the game is undoubtedly the humour- regional accents aplenty swearing like troopers long before Ozzy Osbourne made it fashionable. Talking to a Conker character is like putting the world to rights over a pint in the pub- it's very refreshing to see it in a videogame and very British. Some conservative reviewers have failed to grasp that the bawdiness is no shallow gimickry but an integral part of what is a very polished, well put together adventure game. The cutscenes (such as the famous Great Mighty Poo) add an infinite amount to the character of the game. The graphical design of the levels and characters is wonderful- a rich cartoon world has been created.  Puking, swearing, busty maidens, beer, singing s***- it's a right rich stew of brilliance.

If you make a mistake the scene/story go on. The story itself is sort of interesting, although your connection to the characters is what really makes this worth playing. Fights aren't overly challenging, but mistakes at the wrong time could be costly, and even lead to additional fight sequences. It really engages you in the scene, and has you worried you will get that character killed, the bad guy will get away, etc. And that can happen.

There are some scenes with mundane activities it has you doing that are really necessary to make it a believable character and pull you in. They aren't very interesting or exciting, but they do successfully make the character seem like a real person. Many actions in those scenes just really don't matter  to the plot, and it is possible to just not do them, although I wouldn't recommend that for your first ""play-through.""

5.0,True,"07 4, 2016",AMFP48Y9OFUIZ,B01E57PT4A,Tim,"This is a great keyboard that I would recommend to first-time mechanical keyboard owners and enthusiasts alike. Don't let the unknown manufacturer and the suspiciously low price deter you - this is a fantastic keyboard in so many ways and comes with many different switch and color options to fit your needs.

PROS:
+ Price. You'll be hard-pressed to find a cheaper keyboard that comes with legit Gateron and Cherry MX switches. This aspect alone should be enough incentive for an enthusiast to pick one up just to try some of its more obscure switch options (Gateron Brown/Blue/Yellow, Cherry MX Green/White). Combined with Amazon's generous return policy, this keyboard reduces the amount of commitment to a unique switch type to a record low on a true keyboard.
+ Options. This keyboard has TONS of switch options, several case options, and even multiple backlighting options. Kailh, Gateron, Omron, and Cherry switches are available to try. It's great to see both safe choices as well as more unique and adventurous choices. As seen in the pictures, I went with the silver case, white backlighting, and Gateron Brown switches.
+ Aesthetics. Personally, I LOVE the ""floating-keycap"" style most widely seen on the Corsair keyboards. The all-white look is not nearly as common as black and looks great on this keyboard. The aluminum backplate is stylish and feels great. The stock keycaps on this keyboard are very good, but not amazing; they're definitely better than most other stock keycaps I've tried on CoolerMaster and Logitech keyboards. The keyboard sounds and feels great. Overall, really impressive build quality for the price (so far).
+ Unique layout. I LOVE the 68-key layout. I use the arrow keys and navigation keys too much to lose them, and even though there's no dedicated function-key row above the number row, getting used to using the FN key has not been difficult. This layout is my ideal compromise between form and functionality.
+ ""Standard"" keycap sizes. The keycaps on this keyboard are the ""standard"" size for mechanical keyboards, meaning the spacing of the switches should be compatible with almost all alternative keycap sets. This is very useful for personalizing the keyboard to your liking.
+ Extra features, including DIP switches and backlighting modes. The DIP switches on the back of the keyboard allow for a small amount of customization, including swapping the Windows key and the FN key. The backlighting has 10 levels of brightness and includes a 3-speed ""breathing"" mode. These are all cherries on top and make this keyboard a great overall package.

CONS:
- Difficult to modify. For those hardcore enthusiasts who are interested in desoldering and swapping out switches, this keyboard seems to make that a difficult task due to obscure screw locations to a poorly-wired PCB.
- Mediocre cable. The rubber-coated cable the keyboard comes with isn't great, and you don't have any routing options other than straight out the back. I do appreciate how the keyboard's USB Mini-B type connector is protected by nesting it in an alcove under the board.
- Non-removable logo. I don't mind the Magicforce label etched into the aluminum plate, but I've heard complaints over it elsewhere.

As you can see, my list of negatives is way shorter than my list of positives, which is why I would highly recommend this keyboard (or some variation) to almost anyone who can handle a cut-down keyboard layout.",Great keyboard for almost anyone,1467590400,12,{'Color:': ' 68keys gateron brown switch'},"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61l5GA43p+L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Idud3BrpL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IAKkKPnwL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qMTxMfJOL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618-g-DkDeL._SY88.jpg']"

That unit served me well so with new enhancements to the Xbox X I decided to sell my regular Xbox and buy the new Xbox X (Scorpio Edition).  I also purchased a 4 TB Western Digital Passport External Hard Drive (WDBYFT0040BBK) for $99.00 which is working out great and was very simple to connect.  I have had the new console about a month.  I am loving it and, so far, have had no problems with either the console or external HD.

I have the Xbox X connected to an older LG TV.  An unexpected surprise was how much the graphics quality of my games increased even though my TV is not 4K.  I had also planned on purchasing a 4K TV but, with the graphics increase, I may just save the money.  It loads non-4K games slightly faster and seems to create a smoother gameplay.  I also like the reduced console size.  Packaging was good, protected the unit well, and has a pleasant appearance.

Several reviews indicate a variety of problems with the new console.  I have not had any issues with mine (knock one wood).  I also never had any issues with my Xbox One console. I was looking at also purchasing a PS4 Pro (because I like some of their  exclusive games) but there seems to be many problems with that console according to their verified purchase reviews.  Also Sonys tech support appears to be non-existent according to many of their reviewers.  Bottom line, no matter what tech product you get, some are going to have problems.

5.0,False,"10 6, 2009",A15M18BY0Y5VG5,B002AB7TX8,Chitown Lurker,"Having spent just several hours with this game, it is already difficult to describe. It's difficult. Actually, no, it's punishing. No...in fact, it can be maddeningly infuriating at times. It is also a complete blast.

I don't want to write an essay. In short, though, Demon's Souls is an action/RPG which is a bit like a combination of a 3rd-person adventure like Uncharted, a hack-n-slash action/RPG like Diablo, with the required thoughtfulness in swordplay of the original 2D Prince of Persia (you have to be an old-schooler to remember that one).

The game is difficult, but veterans of the 8-bit days will find the difficulty somewhat nostalgic. The game does not simply restart you unscathed 15 seconds from where you kicked the bucket. Rather, you have to start the level from scratch, and to regain your earned currency (which you earn by killing enemies, and use to buy improvements for your character), you must fight your way back to your corpse in spirit form with half of your health. Die before you get there? Kiss that currency good bye. The game is FAIR, though. You have the option of running, at your liberty, to the beginning of the level and exiting to the starting area to spend your winnings, so that you can return all-the-more powerful. When you feel like you are pushing your luck and the level is outgrowing your character skills, it's time to heed that advice. Of course, this IS a dungeon crawl game, so when you come back the enemies will have returned. Think of it as more souls (i.e. money) to be made.

It helps to go into this game EXPECTING to be in spirit form more often than not. The game assumes you will die a lot. In that sense, one should avoid frustration over death. It's a natural part of the game.

Battle must be approached carefully. Running in and hacking mindlessly will only tire out your character, and likely result in an unceremoniously awkward death to even the most bottom-rungs of the enemy food chain. You must work with your shield, your footwork, and given the right character your magic and ranged weapons to succeed.

All of this alone makes for a fantastic experience beyond any action RPG offered in this generation of games. What makes it a slam-dunk are the online aspects. The single player game takes advantage of your internet connection (though you can opt out by signing out of your PSN account). You will see occasional apparitions of other players fighting through the same level you are. Further, before long you will obtain an item that will allow players to invite you into their games to assist them. Later, a more sociopathic ability is obtained: the ability to break into another player's game, without their consent, hunt them down, and kill them. Either provides a bit of a ""shortcut"" to regaining your body, with the further effect of easing/intensifying the difficulty of the world around you...helping people ""lightens"" the world, harming them ""darkens"" it.

On top of this, the ability to examine bloodstains to view apparitional replays of other players' deaths is fantastic and adds to the feeling that you're not dealing with this alone. The game punishes EVERYONE, and they are struggling with you, and it will prove it via these replays.

This is no quick game. Reports from those who have played the imported non-US version claim play times of 80+ hours to conquer the game for the first time...nevermind 2nd and 3rd playthroughs, which supposedly come at a higher difficulty.

All that said, it is not impossible. In my very first shot at it, I actually survived for a good half hour in the first non-tutorial realm without dying, and when I realized this, I quickly found my way back out and spent my winnings to upgrade before I went and got myself annihilated (and make no mistake...I did shortly thereafter). That is what is fantastic about this game (so far for me at least): if you respect it, play conservatively, and don't do anything you wouldn't try in real life, you CAN have a reasonable chance at survival. Stay on your toes, don't push your luck, and survival IS possible. Often death is simply a result of a lapse in attention or a reckless decision. If, on the other hand, you approach it like you would, say, ""God of War"" or just about any other action game from this generation, you WILL pay a price for your stupidity. And it's wonderful.

Just to wrap up: the graphics are nothing short of what you'd expect in a top flight PS3 game. The sound is amazing...I have never wanted surround speakers so badly. And, as I mentioned, the gameplay is phenomenal.

My only warning: casual gamers need not apply. Do NOT approach this game unless you like a challenge.

If this is the case with you, you should love this game and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it.  It really feels like an extension of Bloodborne (or more accurately, Bloodborne is likely an extension of Dark Souls) so it has be a real delight jumping into this world for a second time around.

The graphics and environment are spectacular in this game, everything from the stunning mountain vistas to the wails and moans of the creatures around the corner all add to a really profound sense of emersion.

If you have any experience with FROM SOFTWARE games, these are very challenging experiences but that is truly what makes them special.  I am not a ""gamer""; intact, I scoff at that term.  So I am not hardcore into this hobby by ANY means.  I simply like to play a game hear and there and, enjoy the experience and then more on to other hobbies that are more fulfilling.  So I am very demanding in what I want from a game.  For me, I either want a game with an amazing, immersive story or a game that provides a truly unique experience.

Although, I hate hate the pretentious vagueness of FROM SOFTWARE games, I have to admit that the difficulty of these games is actually what makes them worth while.  These games are punishingly difficult, but also very fair.  What I mean by that is the enemy of these games are fast, brutal and even the weakest enemies can kill you quickly, but if you practice and build your skill in controlling your character then you will certainly achieve victory.  And in that, this game is able to provide a very genuine sense of accomplishment and excitement when you finally take down that insane boss that has killed you twenty times.

So rather than regurgitate what everyone else has already touched on, I'd say that these games are worthwhile BECAUSE they are so difficult.  That may not be your cup of tea, but for me (a person who doesn't fully appreciate gaming) that is what makes this game very special.

One helpful tip:  this is an action RPG, so treat it as such.  If you are having trouble getting past a boss or area, you need to grind on enemies to level your character and build your skill and reflexes.

The graphics are fantastic and the game is unbelievably atmospheric. Many gamers will also be pleased to know that you don't need a top of the range PC to run this game smoothly. I have relatively average specs and the game runs like a dream (Athlon XP 1700+ 512MB RAM)

You have just been transfered to a prison on an island off the Maryland coast.

5.0,False,"08 6, 2013",A27OW0P38B28OP,B00A6IPHXQ,Relytia,"If one looks at the 3DS with an unbiased, objective point of view, there is a lot to love. It is basically a next-gen successor of Nintendo's vastly successful DS console, with the horse-power of a console somewhere between the Gamecube and the Wii. It utilizes a very cool 3-D effect that, when done right, really adds to the overall immersion of the gaming experiences available on it. Everything about it is an improvement on the original DS. Granted, it also has some caveats and issues as well. The 3DS XL does a very good job delivering the goodness of the original 3DS, while making vast improvements over its smaller brother original. In this review, I will focus on the differences and improvements this model makes on the 3DS line. I'll warn you right now, this is a long review. If you don't like long reviews, then you may want to skip this. :P

Screen Size: With a title that includes ""XL,"" obviously the increase in size is the biggest difference between this and the original 3DS. It may be easy to hear that the screens are 90% bigger than the original, but it really is a stark difference when you take the system out of the package and see it for yourself. The XL's screens are HUGE compared to the original. It's comparable to the jump between the DSi and the DSXL, for those savvy to what that means, but in this case its even bigger because the top screen is in a widescreen format. Despite the size increase, the picture is still crisp and pops with nice detail. I thought that because the screen would be bigger, but with the same resolution as the original, the XL's picture would be distorted and fuzzy, but that's not the case here. I've put the screen detail and quality through rigorous testing since buying the system, playing many different games, and the bigger picture really makes the scenery more detailed than I ever noticed before. It's no exaggeration to say that the games actually feel new due to this greater detail. It's great!

Screen quality: Instead of the top half of the XL having a shiny, glossy finish of the screen and the area around it that the original featured, the 3DSXL features an almost ""smoothed over"" finish that was meant to lessen glare from the sun or other lights from bothering your eyes. It actually makes quite a difference. The trade-off is that the back-lighting seems just a smidgen less bright, but not much at all. One of the biggest problems I had with the original 3DS was the problem of ""ghosting."" It was especially frequent in games with areas of high contrast. This was a common issue people had with the original 3DS, but I haven't noticed it much at all yet with the XL. This is a big plus for me, because that ghosting was one of my biggest gripes with the original. I made my peace with it though, because ghosting naturally occurs from time to time with the tech being utilized in the 3DS, but to have it mostly gone here is a real treat. The colors in the XL seem brighter and a bit more vibrant as well. The touch screen is really nicely made, and seems to be a slight improvement on the original, but the difference is negligible. The saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" comes to mind.

DS backwards compatibility: Honestly, this is one of the best things about the 3DXL. If you look up comparison videos of the first 3DS playing original DS games and a DSi playing DS games, the 3DS is surprisingly inferior. The colors are more bland, the resolution is fairly fuzzy, and if you choose to play it in its native resolution to fix that blurry smudginess, the screen becomes so small it's hardly worth doing that. The XL makes drastic improvements in all of these areas. The colors are just as bright and beautiful as playing on a normal DSiXL. Due to the larger screen size, playing in a native resolution still leaves ample room for playtime and is no longer the cramp experience the first 3DS offered. If you choose that route, the screen will be close to a normal DSi. Even if you don't, the picture is still decent at full-size, shockingly. This fantastic backwards compatibility is a real plus in the 3DSXL's favor and should not be understated. Massive improvement here.

Build quality: Much like the new DSi and DSiXL made notable improvements in build quality to their predecessors, so does the XL refine the design of its predecessor. Instead of an outer glossy finish, there is a sleek matte exterior that makes the XL feel more heavy duty and refined. It definitely has a better build quality than the original. My original 3DS' top screen hinge became fairly loose and the lock-in positions a little weak after just one instance where I accidentally jostled it. The hinges on the XL click and lock into one or two set angular positions before locking into the flat position and I know there's no way this thing is going to break easily at all. That's a really nice improvement. The system is surprisingly slick in its form too. It's about the same thickness as the original (which is kind of clunky in comparison, let's be honest), and even weighs less than expected, despite the larger screen and button size, and this size and shape really comes across as a mature, sleek gadget from Nintendo. I felt the same way about their classy DSiXL system too. The buttons are also vastly improved. The home, select, and start buttons are actual separated buttons that have a bit of click to them, which is a vast improvement. The other buttons have more ""squish"" to them, but still click in a satisfying way. All-in-all, the buttons feel very balanced, if that make sense. They're very similar to the DSiXL's button quality, which is to say, very nice. The 3-D and Volume slider are also different. When all the way off, the 3-D slider clicks into position, and when you want to turn the 3-D effect on, you must click it out of position and then slide it to your desired position. Both the volume and 3-D sliders seem more heavy duty. They stick and stay in position very, very well. A lot of small details add up in this system, to be sure.

Battery life: In my personal experience, the original 3DS had battery life that lasted about 4-5 hours with the 3-D slid up, 5-7 without 3-D, and roughly 6-8 hours with DS games. The 3DS XL is supposed to last 3.5-6.5 hours with 3D, 6-8 without, and 8-10 with DS games. It's not a HUGE improvement, but every bit counts. If you're like me and play a lot of the time with the system plugged into the wall, it won't really matter all that much anyway, but for those who want to play on the go, this is a really nice improvement over the original.

Sound: Supposedly, the sound tech in the 3DSXL is pretty close to the original, but I (and others, I've checked) have noticed some differences. The speakers on the XL seem a bit quieter than the original. Not a ton, mind you, but it's noticeable. The speaker volume level seems to depend on which game you're playing too. 3D Classics: Kirby's Adventure seems just as loud as before, but better now. I tend to play my 3DS with these&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/amazing-headphones/dp/B004N7Q3IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">amazing headphones</a>&nbsp;on, and the difference becomes really noticeable then. The sound from the XL with headphones seems a lot more detailed and ambient than before, and the volume level is fine. The highs, mids, and lows are distinctive with no aspect overpowering or distorting the others. Much like the visuals, I'm hearing things in games I never heard before, and it has enhanced my experience even further. Great stuff here, and a very pleasant surprise!

Memory: The 3DSXL comes with a 4 GB SD card, making for a much bigger space for storage than the 2 GB SD card included with the first models. This is nice. I almost filled my first one up and still had a lot more games to get. Granted, you can buy any sized SD to use with the 3DS after some formatting, but having more space right off the bat is nice.

Any issues?: In many ways, the 3DSXL is what the 3DS should have been from the beginning, and it's a fantastic little handheld. It's not quite perfect though. For one, where's the second analog slider? There's ample room under the right-hand face buttons for it, but alas, no slider. It's not a problem that bothers me much, but I must note it because there are many who will view it as an issue. Imagining the boat-peripheral they're making for this system makes me giggle a bit. It conjures up visions of Nintendo releasing a laptop-sized 3DS with trigger buttons, lol. I understand they kept it out due to tech/power/space optimization, which makes sense. Personally, I never cared much for a second slider, and not having one has pushed developers to come up with some really creative things in the past on the DS and 3DS alike. I also find the design of the XL to be, like the original, cramped and painful to hold after a while, especially in high-action games. It's definitely better, don't get me wrong, but the cramping is still there a bit. I highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-comfort-grip/dp/B008XHCLFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this comfort grip</a>, as it pretty much eliminates any discomfort from playing (too bad it doesn't come in white or pink :/). :D Perhaps the most annoying thing about this handheld is the d-pad. It works just as well as the one before, but now it's extremely ""clicky."" I don't mean the button clicks when you use it; that has always been the case with the 3DS. What I mean is, now the d-pad seems to be looser in its area, and so makes this ""clickety"" sound against the bracket if you lift your thumb off of it even if only for a split-second. It can be really annoying. One more personal gripe: the color choices. Really Nintendo? Bright blue, red, and pink? The DSiXL had really mature, fetching color options that made the system feel like an adult's gadget. These slick red and blue colors are a lot less subtle and elegant. Don't get me wrong, I own a teal 3DS (not exactly the most ""mature"" color choice) and love it, but I wish there had been a more subdued teal, gold, or forest/jade green finish to choose from. This Pink/White XL stands out from the others due to its white highlight instead of black like the others. Objectively speaking, it is very pretty (as a married man, I confidently say that and feel no shame or embarrassment). My wife has a 3DSXL with this color scheme and it is surprisingly eye-catching and clean looking, but like the other color options, it is hardly what I'd call ""mature."" Ah, who cares though, right? It's still a fantastic handheld

I realize this review is very long, but when considering tech purchases that are this pricey, these kind of reviews always helped me make informed decisions better. I have both the original and now the XL, and I must say the 3DSXL feels like the ""true"" 3DS. The system should have been like this from the start, honestly, and when it was originally announced, I, along with many others, hoped for an XL edition. Now we get it and it has been well worth the wait. For those who don't own a 3DS yet, this is the perfect time to get it. This system finally delivers on the promise of the original 3DS, and now there's an absolutely incredible library of titles for newcomers to joyously embrace, and that library grows more amazing with every month it seems. The 3DSXL is easily my favorite and most played gaming device in a long time. At a mere 30$ more than the original for practically double the space and a big jump in hardware quality, it's more than worth it. This is a great value. I'm glad I got the original a year ago, but I am absolutely thrilled to get this version, and heartily recommend it to all gamers with a heart container for Nintendo. It's not a choice you'll regret.  I hope you enjoyed this review and found it helpful. Have a good day.

First, the graphics, because they impress you right from the start. The graphics for the buildings, terrain and units are simply beautiful. From the rotating windmills to the reflections in the water from the sailing ships to the ways in which the units move, its really like watching a little world. You can zoom in and out with ease to get a detailed look or a strategic overview.
Microsoft has been making these games for a while now and really brought together the best of many of them. Much of it is based on the Age of Empires system - build up your civilization, work through ages, build and grow. But they threw in better people-management a la Pharoh and Caesar. Instead of peasants standing around stupidly while farms wait for them, the workers actively seek out what needs to be done. They'll sign on at the lumber mill or farm where workers are needed.
Set up a university, and the building is quiet. Start creating scholars to study there, and you'll see them out front, taking their classes!
Of course there are opponents to deal with. You can of course build up a massive army and go wipe them out. But you can also try to set up diplomacy with them, or out-tech them.
The little touches throughout the game are just amazing. Build in an arctic area and there's snow on your roofs. The music in the backround really draws you into the mood. The controls are all very intuitive and easy to use.

5.0,False,"04 1, 2013",A1KV9ONZ1V8A96,B004D8QAAO,Andy,"I used to think that the Hitman games were lame. But the games are more intelligent than I gave them credit for and I did not know better until I was informed otherwise.

The challenge is to kill only the target without alerting the other NPCs. Stealth in Hitman does not mean only hiding in the shadows and going from point A to point B in a mostly linear path hiding from enemies and executing a sequence of events. It has a very open format - kudos to the makers. How you complete your objective is up to you. It involves hiding in plain sight which can mean disguises to reach close to the target, knocking out guards using anesthetic, sniping from afar but making sure no one see you, engineering accidents, planting bombs near the targets to either distract or kill. All these can be used to complete a level in multiple ways or used in conjunction on the same level. It can also be pure stealth - learn the movement patterns of the NPCs and steal around them. Just one more point, you also need to escape. So if you go in close and do not succeed in a clean kill, the guards are alerted and you may not be able to escape.

Blood money is the best of the lot in the sense that the number of ways to complete the missions are virtually unlimited. Hitman 2 is the most realistic and also the hardest but again with multiple ways to complete. Note that the aim is to get the ""Silent Assassin"" rank - the highest achievable - and that is not dependent on any particular method. You can also KO or kill anyone you like in any manner you see fit but that can affect the rankings. Also each mission can be completed in less than 15 minutes and games who want to challenge themselves do it in less than 5 minutes or even less - all with the highest ""Silent Assassin"" ranking.

Note that Hitman is not a action/shooter game - there are others that do it a lot better. It is also not a stealth game - Thief comes to mind which was pure stealth and where you lost if even one NPC saw you. Hitman is, well a game about being a Hitman - a Silent Assassin - for want of a better term. :)

I am now officially a fan of the series after playing Hitman the first time more than a decade ago and writing it off as a wannabe stealth/shooter game (it was all splinter cell and thief back then) and not giving it a second look.",Hitman is not a stealth/action game... it is however a very intelligent one...,1364774400,4,,

Admittedly I played this one first before I ever even knew that PS2 had a version, so the excitement of first playing the game may be attributed to my love of the PSP version over the PS2 version.  But whatever the cause I enjoyed this one more, and here's why.

This game is so simplistic it's just a blast.  It belongs on the PSP because of its simple graphics and easy to play on the go gameplay.  Both the PS2 and PSP versions have very simple storylines that don't require your full attention to just play the game.  The King of the Cosmos went surfing while on vacation and ended up accidentally destroying all of the land on the planet he was on.  You now have to roll your katamari around and collect items to rebuild the islands and such.  Very similar to the PS2 version in fact, this ported over to the PSP so well that it lacks almost nothing the PS2 version has.  The music and graphics are even the same.  The only difference that most people will notice that have played both versions is that of entering levels.  The PSP version has a shockingly funny way of entering levels where the prince is slingshot into the distance and appears to be hitting the King's crotch.  I fell out of my chair laughing when I first saw this.

If I had to have one complaint about the PSP version it's that your thumbs will hurt...a lot, because of the controls.  It's impossible just to push lightly on the directional pad and buttons to steer the katamari.  You'll find yourself pushing harder on the buttons to try and make it go faster or something and your hands will kill you.

I don't know, I'm sure lots of people are going to continue to misuse the ""helpful"" vote link by clicking no on me simply because they disagree and not because my review wasn't helpful, but I don't care.  The PSP version is well worth a try in my opinion and lacks nothing from the PS2 version.",I know not many people will agree with me on this but...,1223337600,4,,

I had no problems with any bugs.
However,  I didn't play multiplayer for a few months.
I got this based on the 14 minute preview video before the ps4 launched.
Easily one of the best looking games in my opinion.
even better than battlefield hardline.
Way better than any call of duty game.
With the cut scenes from advanced warfare being the exception.
The campaign wasn't all that great but it had great moments.
You can feel the desperation in certain missions.
Another great thing about this game is the levelution.
Bringing down hotel room walls on your enemies during conquests is one of the best things to do in multiplayer mode.
I enjoy battlefield alot better than call of duty now due to The call of duty series becoming stale.
Battlefield felt fresh, looked gorgeous on the ps4 and delivered action on a grand scale.
I enjoy fps, and just when I started becoming bored with the genre, this gem was released.
I also had a few laughs with the helicopters in conquest.
Learning how to control them is by far one of the most difficult things in this game.
All in all, I was impressed with the game.
Campaign could have been better, and longer, but it had alot of action and good voice acting.
Multiplayer was one of the most fun experiences I've had on the ps4.
I highly recommend this game.

For the time, it's graphics were close to cutting edge, and the story is simple, yet actually completing everything 100%, is quite a difficult task depending on what part you're trying to do so on.  The gameplay mechanics are a little stiff, but no more than expected from a game released in 1998 on a system that has been rebooted 4 times since the one this game was developed for.

I didn't plug in the USB cable to my Xbox and they still work perfectly.  Just headset jack into my adapter and its good to go.  The USB is only for the lights but who cares about that.

The controls really work very well for an on the rails shooter. Where as in most games you move the character and the target moves with him, in this game you move the character with the left thumb stick and the target with the stylus on the touch pad which gives you an extra level of control and it works really well. This game is supposed to come with a stand for the 3DS to ease the pain and cramping of the hands from the awkward control scheme although I have never used the stand and have never had any hand issues holding the 3DS and playing this game.

5.0,False,"11 26, 2009",A2J3MR64L567OK,B000NJH6YG,Yossarian,"I'm late to the game with Two Worlds, but I was so disappointed with Dragon Age:  Origins that I found myself looking anywhere for a real RPG that is both playable and actually fun.  I took a chance on Two Worlds despite the poor reviews, and I am extremely happy that I did.

For the longest time while playing, I couldn't figure out what the game reminded me of.  And then it hit me:  Gothic/Gothic 2.  Two Worlds is extremely similar to both games, in everything from the way your character moves, to the equipment, to the magic items and spells, to the layout of the world itself.  This is a very good thing, as anyone who has played Gothic or Gothic 2 will tell you.  Some specifics:

Difficulty.  The game is indeed quite difficult.  Just like Gothic/Gothic 2, you can't simply run off into the woods and hope to survive.  You have to slowly work your way up by first picking off weaker creatures near the main roads, and build up both your levels and your equipment to survive the bigger encounters.  I recommend starting on ""Easy"" which is at least the equivalent to ""Normal"" in most games.  But one key consideration is missing from most other reviews:  dying is not really a punishment in this game.  If (and when) you die, you simple reincarnate at a nearby health shrine.  You don't lose experience, stats, or even any gold.  Moreover, you reincarnate at the nearest health shrine even if you haven't found it yet -- I've accidentally teleported onto the other side of a mountain range by dying and coming back at an undiscovered health shrine.  So the difficulty is not nearly as frustrating as it sounds because you can, if you have to, just die a lot to whittle down a tough monster.  Or lure them close to a mana or health shrine that will constantly power you up as you get hurt.  And when you eventually have that awesome platemail or greatsword and can start 1-shoting monsters that have been killing you for hours, the gratification level is HUGE.

Graphics.  The graphics are a little dated, but not nearly as bad as people say.  Some of the atmospheric effects, particularly fog, are very cool, and there are lots of pretty looking rivers and streams and sunsets to keep up the eyecandy level.  I'm running on 1080p HD and the graphics are as least as good as Dragon Age:  Origins -- despite being 2+ years older.

Gameplay.  This one of the places the game really shines.  There are lots of different ways to play this game.  You can be a warrior with a huge axe, an archer, a mage (with many different sub-types like Earth mage or Water mage to specialize in), an assassin, a hunter, a booby trap specialist, or some combination therein.  Combat is actually a lot of fun, and there's even a backstep/dodge button that works quickly and lets you avoid big hits from other monsters.  My preferred playstyle is to set a few explosive traps, pepper foes with arrows so they charge into those traps, and then smash them with a halberd or greatsword.  But you can also summon hell knights, cast lightning storms, trap foes in magical tentacles, or do almost anything else you want.

Loot.  There are tons and tons of items in this game.  You can customize your character with everything from rings (4 of them!) to armor to boots, to even an assassin knife you use only in backstabbing, or perhaps magic robes and a wizard's staff.  Items have a wide range of powers, but you can improve an item by combining it with an identical item.  This has many subtle effects, like letting you make mediocre equipment really powerful if it is common and you find it a lot, or letting you use something that looks awesome by ranking it up so it's better than the more powerful -- but uglier -- base item.  For example, I found a suit of white mirrored half-platemail that looks fantastic, but is a bit weaker than some other heavy plate.  By combining multiple sets of the white platemail, I both look good and have great armor protection.  Like Gothic 2, there are also tons of alchemy items you can find out in the woods, like mushrooms, flowers, gemstones, and the like.  Some have permanent effects, so you can quickly learn to make potions that give you permanent boosts to all your stats, or even your resistances or physical armor.  This is another great way to toughen up early in the game.

Plot.  The storyline is also entirely adequate.  The voice acting in most (but not all!) places is a little amateurish, but you can skip right through it with the press of a button.  The world map is gigantic and filled with villages, towns, castles, necromancer towers, crypts, graveyards, and everything else you'd want in a fantasy world.  There are tons of side quests, and you will always have something else to do.

Foes.  Another great thing about this game is the huge range of enemies.  You will face all the standard enemies from skeletons to zombies to wolves, but how about death knights, wyverns, dragons, giant scorpions, and even huge preying mantises?  Or perhaps a cave full of enraged dwarves, or huge half-demon half-snake monsters?  Enormous flesh, stone, or wood golems?  Huge orc encampments?  The possibilities are nearly endless, and there are always treasure chests and loot to be found.  Your enemies don't scale much as you level so you can go back and punish them later, but some of their inventory does scale so it is always worth checking to see what they carried.

There is a lot more that can be said about this game (both archery and booby trap setting deserve their own entries) but some things should be experienced directly.  In my opinion as a long-time gamer, this game has been unfairly maligned and should be given another close look.  If you have ever played Gothic or Gothic 2, you will find this game very similar -- and a heck of a lot of fun.

Since those days, I've longed for a game that rewarded pure stealth and strategy over blazing guns and quick trigger fingers. I found partial relief in Metal Gear Solid 2, but it was definitely not the same. Now, at last, my thirst has been quenched by /Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell/.

Pros:
 * Immersive gameplay with a heavy emphasis on staying in the shadows and keeping quiet.
 * Nice gadgets to play with. You've got just enough tech to make your missions possible, but not so much that you are overwhelmingly superior. Spy on conversations, peek under doors, see in the dark. Cool toys, and all very useful.
 * Great graphics for the PS2, with impressive lighting and atmospheric effects. Fabrics billow in the wind and swirl around objects, lanterns sway in the breeze, etc.
 * Excellent voice acting and sound effects. The pre-rendered cut scenes are very nice, although not exactly movie quality. The DVD style ""extras"" are rather cool, also.
 * VERY tight control scheme. It may not be 100% intuitive, but it feels a lot better than MGS2 (which, to me, seems a little sluggish).

Cons:
 * Not all lights can be shot out to make shadows to hide in. This is probably a limitation imposed by the PS2's dynamic lighting capabilities. It does limit your creativity at certain points in the game, though.
 * Frequent breaks in the action to load new areas (on the plus side, this gives you frequent chances to save your game).
 * No multiplayer. C'mon, I can't be the only one who wants to skulk around in the shadows and assassinate the virtual versions of my friends, right?

Here's the bottom line: Splinter Cell is THE stealth action game for PS2. It looks great, sounds great, and plays great.

It merged RPG elements into a First Person Shooter and allowed multple ways to finish every mission, which raised the reply value. I am actually upset because there aren't more games like this one. We see the same generic FPS formula redone over and over again. Companies can still learn from Deus Ex and they should. Deus Ex offers some very satisfying gameplay. Even though Deus Ex seems to be a FPS, it allows you to do things that you don't normally find in an FPS. You can hack computers, use lock picks on doors, and blow up doors. That is an example of how Deus Ex gives you multiples ways to accomplish an objective. The way you kill is also a factor. You can use melee weapons, pistols, heavy guns, and sniper weapons. You can actually increase you effectiveness with using these weapons by raising your experience level in them. This little tidbit makes the game quite addictive.

The game looks amazing and the controls are very smooth and easy to get use to. The story is about a rich young guy named Jason Brody and how he and his friends took a vacation to Bangkok, The last thing they wanted to do before going back home was to skydive, but little did they know the dangers that lurked below them. They ended up getting captured and the whole story is around how Jason escapes and tries to rescue his friends. The story has some shocking moments in it. Once you start the story you won't want to quit, but once you finish the story there is still plenty of things to do like hunt, craft, activate radio towers and so much more. One fault this game has though is it's multiplayer. Unlike the singleplayer the multiplayer is not open world. The multiplayer felt like a Call of Duty game actually with it's closed in maps, but the zip lines do add some fun to it. Still I think Ubisoft could have spent a little more time on the multiplayer, but they did add a nice addition that kind of makes up for that, and that's the map editor. The map editor is quite impressive in this game actually. It gives you many options to make a great multiplayer map, and allows you to test it with online players. Sadly it's not perfect though, because there is some limits on the objects you can add. I have truly enjoyed this game and would defiantly recommend it to anyone that's looking for a good sandbox FPS game.

The kennel:  When you first power up Nintendogs you'll find yourself knocking on the door of a kennel.  Inside you'll find six starting breeds with 3 different types for each one that vary between gender and personality.  The types of the dogs change after each time you enter.  You have only 1000 dollars to spend and you can only pick one dog.  I picked a male Shiba Inu and then we were back at home.

Home:  You are limited to your house after you come home from the kennel.  Your house is where you will train your dogs, feed them, and play with them.  It is also the link to everywhere else.  You have to calm your dog down before you can name it.  You have to say your dog's name several times before it actually learns it like any trick.  You then have to teach it to sit following the on screen instructions before you can do anything else.  After that you can basically do anything.

Supplies list: This is where everything you found, bought and need for your dog.  They are divided into groups to make it easier to find what you need.

Go Out:  This is the link to everything else.

The following titles are located in Go out.

Walk:  You will probably be spending the most time in this section.  Before  you can walk you have to draw the route you want to go and come back to your house.  When the stamina bar goes to the bottom, you can't go any farther and you have to redraw the route.  The more you walk, the more your stamina bar will increase so you can go to new places.  To enter something, just draw up to the entrance and continue on with your walk.  Your dog can only walk every thirty minutes.  The places that you can enter are:

Parks:  These are wide open places that perfect for disc competitions.  Sometimes there are other dogs there who you can play with.  Basically your house except it's bigger and you can't teach your dog new tricks here.

Gym:  These are used for practicing for the current level of agility trials you are on.  They contain obstacles that match the current skill level of agility trials you are on.  Only after coming here may you do agility trials.

Discount Store:  Basically a pet supply store only the items are a lot cheaper.

When you're dog is walking it's the only time you're dog goes to the bathroom so make sure you clean up after them or you will be fined.  If you go over a blue item box on the screen you'll find neighborhood dogs to play with or your dog will find a free gift.

Info: Which is located in the go out section displays trainer points, friends list, your profile, trainer accomplishments, and things like that.

Contests: Which is located in the go out section has three different contests you can enter each having five difficulty classes.  If you you get third place or above, you get a trophy with a cash prize and you move up to the next difficulty.  If you don't get in the rankings, you go down one difficulty level.

Disc competition:  You throw a frisby and judging by how far it goes and if your dog catches it in mid-air will determine how many points you'll get.  Poke your dog to make it come back and do it over again.  You have sixty seconds to get a certain number of points.  If your dog misses it, you won't be awarded any points and your dog still has to bring the disc back.

Agility Trial: You control your dog and make it jump over obstacles and go through tubes and things like that.  If you mess up on an obstacle you'll get a fault.  Get a certain number of faults and you'll lose.  Whoever has the best time and the least amount of faults  will win.

Obedience Trial:  I have not tried this out yet but I believe if you say the right command and your dog does it correctly, you won't lose any points.  But if your dog doesn't obey the comannd, you'll lose points and whoever has the least amount of mistakes will win.

You can only enter 3 contests per day with each dog.

Bark mode: Multi-player.  I can't do it yet because my brother doesn't have the game yet.  You can play together.  I think that sums it up pretty nicely.

Shopping:  Well this is where you buy and sell stuff.  The following titles are links.

Kennel:  Buy and look at dogs.

SecondHand shop: Sell stuff here.

Interior Decorator:  Remodel your house.

Pet Supply Store: Buy supplies here.  I usually just buy stuff from the discount store because it's so much cheaper.

Dog Hotel: Since you can only have three dogs in your house, this is where you can put other dogs or just if you want to take care of only one dog at a time.  You should swap dogs every now and then to make sure they're fed and have enough water.(Your dogs won't die if you don't feed them or if you don't give them water.)

The Dogs:  My family doesn't have a dog but the dogs in here act like real dogs.  I'm guessing it's similar to raising a real dog too.  The graphics display the dogs perfectly.  No other system could have been better for this game.  The town looks amazing when you walk through it.  I love watching my dogs wrestle and mess around in my house.  The sound effects are cool too.  I love how each dog has their own bark.

Overall a great game, good replay value.  The game is kind of boring in the beginning because you can't do much but after you another dog, it's awesome.  A must buy.  My only regret is I want more places to go to when you're walking your dog.  I wish you could go to other people's houses and play with them instead of encountering them when you go over a blue box.

I was irritated by the first Far Cry with the save game issues, I was annoyed with the second Far Cry with the constant checkpoint fights.  So I came into playing this game for the supposed hype to see the much touted graphics and quit the game a couple hours in after some annoying design flaw.  After 8 hours of play I'm really getting into this game.
Things I like:
1.  Graphics - very nice graphics
2.  Fast Travel - although there isn't a lot of spots to fast travel to, there are enough to break up the map to reduce long travel.  Game world is beautiful and there is hidden loot and collectibles strewn about, so if you have to travel, it isn't a complete wast of time.
3.  Stealth - Stealth and how AIs react to it works great.  You can hide in shadow and in cover and they will not notice you.  They won't notice you until you make some sort of noise that is within their area of detection.  Even if they hear it, they do not necessary catch you, they start to search for you in the general direction of said noise.  You also have an unlimited supply of rocks to help lead them away.  If they see a body, mobs start to fan out looking for the culprit, instead of them all heading in your direction even though you did not provide a tell.
4.  Combat - Very smooth combat.  AIs are smart, but not clairvoyant.  Very easy to do guerilla type tactics to run in and shoot, then blend into the shadows attacking from a different direction.  Also there is additional strategy such as attacking a base, you can open up animal cages in hopes the animals will attack the mobs.
5.  mini-games - poker, knife throwing, races, time challenges, etc.  They have a ton of mini games that are fun to play.  My favorite was hide and seek where you have to kill as many mobs in a set amount of time.  Sneaking through with a silencer and a knife cutting down people trying to get 450 pts was a blast.
Things I dislike:
1.  Economy - Your cash supply is limited by how big of a wallet you have.  You start off only able to hold $1000, and you have to locate materials to craft a bigger wallet.  You have to do the same thing with the number of weapons you can hold, number of health kits, number of arrows.  Thankfully they give you the location of the animals on the map, so you know generally where you need to go to get the mats.  So you can easily get necessary upgrades fairly early in the game.
2.  Animals - they are fast, small, easily concealed in grass and brush, and your only warning is their growling.  I have no idea how many times I died due to being attacked by crazy boars, komodo dragons and some sort of ostrich.  When I try to aim at one, I hear two more, and I can't see where they are at.  I do have to say the animal AI is smart, instead of only attacking me, they attack anything.  I lucked out on clearing an outpost because two leopards had wandered into camp, and killed off half the camp for me.  The spawn rate appears to be low though, so it isn't something you have to worry about constantly.

5.0,False,"07 11, 2017",AWPP6EHM9WSFO,B01GOQHDJ4,Siege,"Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is a remake of FFXII for PS2.  It has updated graphics and some tweaks to the game system.  It still is essentially a port of a PS2 game, so the presentation is still a little clunky. I poured more than 95 hours into the PS2 version back in the day.  And I am loving the PS4 remake so far.

 FFXII  is somewhat unique title among FF games.  Some people really disliked the Gambit system and the real time encounters when the game was on PS2.

5.0,True,"12 20, 2015",A3EKT69GWBSETY,B00DB9JV5W,Mr. Charles J. Lore,"FYI - I would actually give the game 4.5 stars, but that is not an option, so I rounded up.

Halo 5 is a great, fun and extremely ambitious game that, unfortunately but ultimately, collapses under the weight of its own ambitions. It is by no means perfect, but it is a great game, and mostly certainly is not nearly as bad as the reviews would suggest. Of all of my X-Box One games, I have probably put more time into this game than any other (with the exception of The Master Chief Collection). But Halo 5  has a lot in common with Halo 2, in that the gameplay is great, but the marketing for the game made you think the story was going to be different from what it was. Also the ending leaves you wanting more, and not necessarily in a good way.

The game mechanics have been greatly improved. You can aim, run, charge, ground-pound, climb, and have limited use of thrusters. While the controls take some getting used to (I keep hitting left trigger to throw a grenade, which is now used to aim, and can't seem to get out of that habit), they are significant tighter. The weapons have all been tweaked so that everything has its pros and cons. Some are more versatile than others but each feels unique and more utilitarian. So, for instance, the run-of-the-mill assault rifle has a more controlled spray, but it is still not as refined or exact as the battle rifle or a good pistol. The Promethean weapons, which previously just felt like minor variations of human weapon counterparts, are all now substantially more distinct.

The maps are... different, and I am not entirely sure if that is a positive or negative. The one thing I always liked about Halo games were the sheer size of the maps: how they could be linear, but were so large that they never actually felt linear. In Halo 5, the maps are significantly smaller, in both size and the length of time it takes to beat that particular level; I would say each is on average probably half or even a third of the size and length of time of the average map in Halo 2 or 3. But the offset is that they are somewhat less linear; the game rewards exploration, as you can find hidden passages that allow you to flank your opponents in ways that you never could before.

The plot follows the trend of Halo games, in that the storylines grow increasingly incoherent. If you don't keep up with secondary sources (and I don't), you may not necessarily know why Master Chief all of a sudden has three Spartan buddies (I always assumed he was the last of his kind) following him around everywhere, or why Dr. Halsey is a one-armed fugitive (there's a joke there that I don't have the time to look for), or who Locke is and why we should care. You may not know that humans previously had been an interstellar species, that they had had a war with Forerunners, that they lost, and that the Forerunners took their stuff and left them on earth to be a primitive species again. I have never considered understanding the storyline to be integral to enjoying Halo, but I do like to know what's going on, and that is what wikis are for. Suffice it to say, the main point of the game is to go where the arrows tell you to go to, shoot what needs to be shot, and save the universe.

The major letdown for me in comparison to previous games is how short the campaign mode is, given the increasing shift toward multiplayer online gaming. I would estimate that, all other things being equal, I could play through Halo 5 in slightly more than half the time that it would take to get through Halo 1 through 4 (Halo ODST being the obvious exception). And considering the fact that it is the campaign mode that I really buy the game for more than anything else, that is a problem. I like single-player campaigning and split-screen multiplayer. If you're going to force me to use online multiplayer, at least have some story going on, as with Spartan Ops. But Spartan Ops is gone.

There is Warzone, which is really just two big teams of players going at it. I'd like Warzone if there was more variety to the maps, but I just get the same map over and over again. I'd like to assume there are more, but the game isn't particularly helpful in showing newbies who aren't used to online gaming how to get the most out of the experience.

Much has been said about the loss of the split-screen option. I am not going to join the chorus of people complaining about it, except to say that I do miss it because I like playing with my wife or kids. But the option of playing through the campaign mode with up to three friends online is very cool. I have an old friend from high school who now lives in another state; I haven't seen him face-to-face in years, but we played through the campaign mode for 5 hours straight last night. And it was then that I decided that I really do love Halo 5.

So overall, Halo 5 is a brilliant game at what it does: it's just that what it does may not have been what you wanted it to do. The graphics are a huge leap forward, the gameplay is greatly improved, and in general the game is a crapload of fun. It is definitely a different experience from other games that are out there, which is great, but the fact that it is so different from its own predecessors is what is garnering a lot of negativity: some of it deserved, some of it not so much. If you just want a game that feels like the original Halo, or the more recent Halo 4, you should know that there are a lot of changes, some of which you won't like. For me, Halo 5 is a beautifully flawed game that doesn't accomplish everything that it sets out to do but still manages to be better than most of what is out there.

Couple of random points:

- On the whole, I like the shift to squad-based play. The conversations are interesting to listen to, especially since it gives a reason for exposition. But the offset is that there is no longer a feeling of isolation the way there usually is in Halo.
- The game has several parts where the combat goes into a cut-scene. The most notable, and annoying, part of the game where this happens is where you have to take out the Elite boss that is holding Dr. Halsey hostage. You do not get to fight him, at all. I assume the point was to have a scene that shows the player how badass Locke is - but we know Locke is badass, because he is a Spartan with all of the same abilities of Master Chief.
- A lot of people make a really huge deal out of the deceptive marketing. It's true that the gameplay really does not make much use of the plot conceit, which is that Master Chief is rogue, and that the Spartans are hunting him down. At no point in the game do you, as a player, get to face off against another Spartan, or anyone who could otherwise be considered a friendly. This echoes the marketing of Halo 2, which had trailers showing the Covenant invading Earth. It didn't bother me much, but it would have been cool to have a confrontation that amounted to more than one 30-second cut scene.","Halo 5 is a great game, but you need to know what you're getting into first.",1450569600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

(EDIT -- I just read the reviews of other gamers. I found that babysitting each of my units on the battlefield was difficult at first, but after a period of time, it became extremely easy. The camera controls allow for you to quickly reposition over each of your units, and as long as you remember where you told each one to go, then you'll be fine! One person also noted that sometimes your cities will be fully stocked with army units and magically seem to surrender to the enemy -- this is not a bug, the computer can use diplomats to bribe your governors/armies into surrendering, just like you can! The whole idea on the battlefield is to use your units strategically.. try to draw the enemy toward one group and run up behind them with another and such. These are not bugs in the game, they are the way the game was programmed -- on purpose! If you pay attention to your in-game advisors, they even tell you that. I have a 4.0 GPA at my university in the field of computer science/math minor, so maybe I have brain cells that other people lack or something -- but as long as you are able to keep track of what's going on around you [sometimes the game becomes so complex you'll actually get a slight headache, but it makes it that much more fun] and plan a sound strategy, you CAN accomplish anything!)

I recently grew tired of the redundant first person shooters, and decided to try something else. I played the original Civilization and the Red Alert/Command and Conquer games, which were a lot of fun... But wow, these types of games have come a long way since then!

My computer/operating system setup consists of Windows XP Professional running on an Intel P4 3ghz machine (2.8 overclocked -- 800mhz FSB and HT technology) w/ 2 gigs of dual channel DDR 400, 21"" Nokia monitor, and GeForce 5700 256mb graphics card. I can run Rome: Total War at maximum resolution/detail settings all the way around on the campaign map (since the main campaign map is turn-based, it doesn't use a whole lot of resources) and near-maximum settings on the battlefield with no lag (battlefield is real-time!).

When you start the game, you must first play through the Prologue mode. This is a very small campaign with limited factions -- it is mainly to teach you the basics of the game. The manual is almost ninety pages, so the prologue helps get you going if you don't want to read it right away! After you complete the ""scripted"" part of the prologue, you can continue to play it or create a new, complex campaign, or play one of the many historical battles, or even create your own custom battle!

In the main campaign modes, there are about fifteen factions. Three of them are from Rome (you choose one to play) and the rest are from other places in the world (England, Egypt, Spain, and several others). If you choose to run a short campaign in easy mode, you will have to capture fifteen settlements and survive longer than two of the specific factions (you do this by either destroying them yourself or waiting until someone else destroys them). If you choose to run a long campaign, you will have to capture FIFTY settlements and destroy most of the factions! I just completed a short campaign, and it took me twenty-one hours.

Once you start playing this game, it's IMPOSSIBLE to put down! I didn't sleep last night, and it's now almost two o'clock in the morning tonight :) Not only can you build your cities and your armies, and wage war against the other settlements and factions.. You can also recruit diplomats to negotiate (peacefully or forcefully) with other factions, spies to secretly invade areas to figure out weak spots in your enemy and help sneak city gates open for your armies to run through, and assassins to sneak behind enemy lines and take down generals and kings or burn down buildings! When you enter into combat, you can either allow the computer AI to solve it (sometimes this is more effective and a lot less time consuming), or the computer can place you on a real-time battlefield where YOU control each unit in your army! Each unit type has their own strengths and weaknesses, and special abilities. You must master these, along with special tactics, to take down your enemies with minimal casualties on your side! When you take over a settlement, you can actually build battering rams, ladders, and other equipment to help you bash through the gates/scale the walls... You can hurl heavy stones or flaming objects from catapults.. You can shoot over the walls with regular or flaming arrows from your archers... When defending a settlement, if you have the proper setup, you can dump burning oil down the sides of your walls and have your archers light your enemies on fire with flaming arrows! There are so many different unit types -- you even get war-dogs and incendiary pigs (pigs covered in oil that you light on fire and drive at the enemy!!!!!) This game lets YOU do what YOU want, WHEN you want! It's EXCELLENT! In the campaign-map mode, you can control what each of your settlements produces, their tax rates, their governer.. etc. You have to try to keep your people happy while still making a profit, or you will either go broke or your subjects will revolt and throw you out of the city! You can also harness the power of naval fleets, and use them to spread your intentions across the ""world"". Make alliances, break alliances, make trade agreements, put contracts out on factions, order factions to pay you money or die.... Embark on side-missions for the Roman senate (or conquer them if you like)... Even choose who the women in your bloodline marry. The world created by this game is so immersive it's unbelievable!

Aside from the gameplay, the graphics, sound, and stability also deserve 10s! The game plays flawlessly on my system for twenty plus hours with no bugs, no crashes -- nothing that makes me want to cuss and throw my computer out the window! (except maybe losing to an army that I outnumber) The graphics and colors are superb and use anti-aliasing to its fullest! The sounds are amazing.... Click on infantry and hear them stomp their feet on the ground and yell ""SIR!"" or listen to the rumbling of your cavalry as they drive into battle -- it REALLY gets the blood flowing!

5.0,False,"06 3, 2015",AI0PLL5DQAHRG,B00UXI36FU,Ty Arthur,"This crowd funded phenomena takes the best aspects from previous D&D games and weaves them together with more modern gameplay techniques. From Temple Of Elemental Evil they took the huge range of clothing options and 3D style animations. From Planescape: Torment they took the text-heavy story, incentive to keep talking to your party members over time, and ability to converse with the dead. From Baldur's Gate comes the real-time-with-pause combat and familiar map exploration. Baldur's Gate II meanwhile lent the stronghold system and large segmented cities to explore.

It should go without saying that if you don't dig reading lengthy conversations, or you didn't grow up with the glory of the Infinity Engine games, then Pillars of Eternity is very likely not for you. For those who have craved a return to classic gaming of this kind however, Pillars delivers on every front. Rather than taking from an established campaign setting, Pillars is set in an original world, which is refreshing as the Sword Coast of the Forgotten Realms is really played out at this point, and learning the world's history is half the appeal. There's a definite Celtic flavor to the fantasy this time around, and reincarnated souls living out many lives plays a huge role in the story (bringing to mind a bit of Katherine Kerr's work).

The cast of characters is interesting and they all banter with each other (and reveal backstory tidbits) in conversations completely independent of the main character. Some of the oddity of Torment really comes through here as you learn more about your companions. Durance for instance has the philosophical arguments of Dakkon mixed with the fire lust of Ignus, except he's a priest who happens to hate his god. Remember the morose elf Xan from Baldur's Gate? Aloth has a lot in common with him, only he's got a second personality that pops out whenever the pressure is on, and that personality is a loud mouth who constantly comes up with new and inventive ways to tell people to go bugger their sisters at the exact wrong moment. Having greatly enjoyed all the dialog so far in Pillars, honestly I wish Obsidian was handling the writing for the upcoming Torment: Numenera rather than InXile, which did a rather medicore job in comparison with the characters and writing for Wasteland 2.

The locations and story also frequently bring up that beloved oddity from Torment, with giant machines that manipulate souls, cities full of the dead, and an absolutely killer segment beneath a sanitarium filled with people with broken or missing souls.

On the gameplay front, anyone who spent hundreds of hours on the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games will be right at home. There are a few changes and some concepts have been streamlined, however. Crafting and enchanting for instance can now be done by anyone at any time and is much less complicated  which I like, but others may not if you prefer a complex crafting system that makes you hunt down specific items and locations.

The stronghold element is a ton of fun, and there's a clear sense of accomplishment as you fix and upgrade different portions, seeing rooms go from broken down and cobweb-filled to shiny and new. While it's built into the story  you can't possibly miss it  after first taking ownership of the keep that entire element becomes essentially optional, so you don't have to manage the stronghold if that doesn't appeal to you.

For those who like a good old dungeon crawl, there's a (completely optional) 15 level dungeon beneath the keep with increasingly difficult enemies and bosses, as well as some interesting story additions as you find objects and journals left behind by those who tried to clear it out in years past. Remember the incredibly hard dragon fights from Baldur's Gate II? Those get resurrected after a fashion here. The drake on level 5 of the Endless Paths handily devoured my party the first time I strolled into his sacrificial blood chamber. On the second go around I came prepared, setting traps and using many potion buffs before hand, leading the drake and his minions into a tight tunnel so I would have the tactical advantage. That time I just barely survived, with half the party down before the drake finally died.

At only 12, the level cap is fairly low (although to be fair, Baldur's Gate had a level cap of 10 when it came out) and it seems like when the game first launched that caused some complaints. I waited until the fifth patch (where that experience point issue was specifically addressed) to pick the game up and I haven't had any issues with it. Even after thoroughly exploring the optional dungeon and undertaking every side quest I can find, I haven't hit the cap yet.

With the success of the Kickstarter campaign I'm hoping this is just the beginning, because Pillars really scratched the Infinity Engine itch, and there's a lot more that could be done with this style and setting.",Baldur's Wind Dale: Temple Of Elemental Torment,1433289600,3,{'Edition:': ' Hero'},

Maximo is like an Action/Adventure game we don't get anymore. So what if the game is just hack and slash!  From all the previews I read of this game that is what I expected.  So what if they're too may enemies, no one complained about that in the Contra series or any other game like this.
The game presents a great challenge in a light I haven't seen since the good ol days of my NES.  But even if the game is a good challenge, its nothin to complain or get excited about.  Once you realize how easy it is to battle enemies you'll feel strange knowing you ever lost to them in the first place.  But the other disappointment with the difficulty is that bosses are a bit easy (but to be truthful what game actually has a tough boss nowadays on the PS2?)
I was not in any way disappointed with this game, and after reading all the bad reviews that people gave it I almost didn't get it.  But then when I heard it was an old fashioned Action/Adventure game you can't resist.
Don't listen to all these bad reviews (they're mostly just complaining anyway).
The gameplay is fun and interesting but some of it can get really annoying sometimes like when you die and then when the game over toll keeps increasing making it harder to continue.  The game is great and exciting for an Action/Adventure gamer.
The game was good in the aspect of graphics and sound.  The music is so good and gets you into the game.  The Voice acting is top notch.  While the story is the basic ""Save the princess and restore peace to the land"" stores I had no problem with it this time (as IF, HOW MANY OLD CLASSIC GAMES HAD THAT!!! Mario also comes to mind.)  The game is funner and presents a good challenge but its more about skill then difficulty.  The game doesn't even get hard until the fourth world!

There is just something about sumptuous imagery, action-packed gameplay, and spectacular level design that just soothes the nerves.
God of War II improves the gameplay with more moves, more variety of gameplay syles and enemies, and of course improved graphics and grandiose bosses and environments. I'm not one to really care about stories in video games, but GOW was interesting enough that I actually wanted to watch the cut scenes. Anti-hero Kratos continues his bad-boy antics, butchering all those who get in his way or using them for his own selfish purposes. His raison d'etre is quite shallow; revenge upon the Gods who betrayed him, namely Zeus. But hey, it's a good enough excuse for some gory action. Just like with the first GOW, I've seen some reviews from people accusing this game of simply being an ultra-violent, mindless button-masher. They must not've played it all the way thru. Sure it utilizes those two factors to make for an interesting game, but there is so much more to this game. Play it on the highest difficulty especially and you'll find you will need to incorporate more strategic thinking. And with plenty of unlockables, it has a huge replay value. The only negative thing I can think of is that the difficulty is a bit lower than the first one.

I researched all the time management devices and chose BOB.  I've owned and used BOB for 8 months now and am very happy with the purchase.  It does everything it says it does.  It also helps the kid organize their time better.  We only give each child 1 hour and 4 minutes and it makes them plan and organize and be aware of their television viewing, especially if there is a show on that they really want to watch.  There is never any arguing anymore and we don't have to constantly check up on the kids every half hour (they are 10 and 11) and tell them to play outside or go to bed.  It is really useful on the weekends when the kids are allowed to stay up later and we go to bed early.  We can be assured they are not on the television all night and still get our rest.  It also helps us during summer days when we are outside doing yardwork, BOB insures that the kids aren't coming back in the back door and watching t.v. instead of getting exercise by playing in the sun (kids can be sneaky).  It is very sturdy and works well PLUS BOB IS THE ONLY TIME MANAGEMENT DEVICE THAT WILL WORK ON LARGE TV'S OR BIG FLATSCREENS.  We have it hooked up to a 42 inch Samsung Flat Panel and it works flawlessly.  I have it connected just to the tv because as long as the tv is under control, it controls the Nintendo Wii, tv viewing and DVD instead of having it control all.  This also insures that my TIVO still is on and records my shows but turns off the t.v so the kids can't watch anything once they use up their time.  You can also get reports from it and analyze the tv viewing and it lets you know when the kids are trying to break into it by attempted hacking.  I haven't found any complaints.  I lost the master code once and called customer service and they were really helpful and courteous.  They solved my problem quickly.  This is a great product and worth every penny (even though I got it on sale for nearly half off! yay me.)",I Love BOB!,1244419200,7,,

Kind of like how Halo and Metroid Prime described how an FPS should be and how Soul Calibur showed how Fighting games should be made on next genn systems Socom showed how Online Gaming is meant to be played.
For Noobs to the game, socom is about you leading a group of Navy Seals and doing various missions. But this isn't a shoot em up game, oh no its not. This is a game based on stealth. You use foilage, just like real Navy Seals to get to your desiginated goals and your point in the game is to not be fast, but to be quiet and efficient. On your tv is only half the game though, the game really starts when you hit it online.
Online Socom is amazing. There's a headset, where you can talk to your teamates on and there are desginated missions for you and you counter-sterrorists/navy seals team to do. There's always a feeling like your actually in them game, something the headset really helps you with. It brings the game to life alot. It's as if anything you feel you say like if someone's being dumb and your thinking omg look at this idiot hes gonna get killed - you can say it right on the spot - no typing likein counter-strike just straight up talking.
The gameplay in Socom isn't the only good thing. Yje graphics and sound are well done too. Not online the sound seems to have alot of polish on it. The guns sound genuine, the voices are done well, especially the german and other european languages - they all are accurate and well done.

5.0,False,"11 26, 2014",A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B00JUFT3HW,Brian,"Dragon Age has gone through ups and downs, from the original everyone loved to the sequel most people hated. Inquisition follows your character being the only survivor of a titantic explosion that opens a rift into the demon held world of the Fade. The Chantry wants your head for a heretic and there is a massive war between the rogue mages and the Templar order due to the explosion killing both sides leadership.

Characters are highly polished if a little clunky. A few old standbys return and are well slid into place in the current storyline, but the new characters fell a touch bland compared to pigeon hating golems and slave-mercenaries with magic tattooed into them.

The world is massive and crisp and well delivered, with hidden nooks to explore and none of the feeling of having a few halls and rooms to look around per level. You can jump up mountainsides, while looking abysmally stupid, and find hidden gems, feeling more like exploring the countryside of Skyrim. You can ""explore"" your immediate area which highlights findable and collectibles, a desperately needed feature so you aren't searching for a needle in a stack of needles.

Voices are Bioware level quality, though the French accents should've been better handled.

Gameplay is where there are some hits and misses. Find and fetch quests abound, and the world is sprinkled with massive overpowered enemies, and you can suddenly find yourselves swamped by enemies that crush you like eggs because they're twice your level. Exploring some areas is a pain due to enemies respawning at every rest stop. Shields are way overpowered and shield characters do little but be bullet sponges that're left for last. Magic is well handled but still feels like a catch all. Environmental effects add a nice flavor to combat but should've been better handled, as that fire on that patch of grass should not burn forever.

Customization and UI are clunky and unwieldy. New equipment is oddly handled and should've gone back to DA1, which was maybe a laundry list but easy to navigate and use, whereas the new system leaves m wondering at times if I'm actually equipping gear or not.

The main plot device is bizarre and not well explained from the offset, but otherwise the story progresses nicely after a somewhat rushed opening. Politics and diplomacy play a larger role which is nice and you have more options than just red and blue, so handling your party members is more of a challenge than just knowing ""him blue/her red."" Combined with lore that includes poetry, songs, and personal side stories that're actually quite touching do much to make this feel more vibrant and alive, even if you're the only person who doesn't seem bolted to the floor.",A huge open world to drink in,1416960000,,"{'Edition:': ' Deluxe', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

After seeing video reviews on other usb N64 contollers I have to admit I was a little skeptical about this controller but I can say, after trying this controller out on the Perfect Dark game I was proven wrong. This controller is modeled after the original N64 controller, minus the long hand grips on both sides of the controller. That doesn't bother me one bit though that it might deter OEM N64 controller fans. It's very comfortable in my hands. It doesn't feel cheaply made whatsoever. All the buttons handle well when pressed and the analog stick moves well in it's cradle. The only beefs I have with it is the analog sensitivity might be a little high but that can be adjusted (it's not anywhere near as bad as the Retrolink analog issue FYI).

It's a game about Zombie Apocalypse.  Yet it's very well crafted and fun.  If you love Zombies, then Left 4 Dead is going to really keep you on your toes.

There's no story here.  You play as one of four characters who are trying to survive the apocalypse.  And that's all your goal is throughout the campaign.  Of course, there's no way survival will be easy with zombies and other monsters coming at you from all directions.  There are plenty of weapons to find and ammunition is plentiful.  What makes the game hard is how fast you can be overcome by your adversaries, despite having plenty of weapons and ammo.  Your health will dwindle quite fast throughout Left 4 Dead.  On the other hand, things aren't always over when your health runs out.  You'll be incapacitated when your health depletes and be restricted from moving.  You can, however, shoot when you are on the ground.  Your allies can always come and revive you so that you can get going.  Even if you succumb to the enemy and die permanently, you can hope that your allies will find you as a survivor and you can jump back into the game.

Going about the campaign with actual humans is much more fun than AI.  Mostly because you can set up better strategies and because the AI tends to get into a lot more trouble than is worth saving them from.  There's a lot of fun to be had from all the weapons and explosives you can pick up and toss at your enemies.  You and your allies will be on your toes for the entire campaign.

The only real problem with the campaign is that it's really short.  Normally this would be a big problem for a game.  With Left 4 Dead, however, it's a plus.  The campaign is never the same thing twice.  You'll experience enemies in different locations every time, and you'll experience them in different numbers every time.  You might have a breeze going through it once and be taken down the next time.  The game manages to be incredibly difficult either way.  As a result, replaying the game is always welcome just because the experience is never the same and the same strategy rarely (if ever) works twice.

Graphically, Left 4 Dead is incredible.  The character models are outstanding to look at, and so are the environments.  The zombies are also incredibly detailed.  It's also amazing that with all the chaos that can happen on screen at one time the framerate never slows down.  I've also experienced no problems taking it online.

Better than the graphics may be the sound.  The sound effects from the zombies are bone chilling.  The music is also good, for the most part.  But the highlight of the sound comes from the characters themselves and how they interact with one another when you perform certain actions.  Shoot a teammate and he'll chastise you.  They call out when you find ammo, weapons and they scream whenever they've been overrun with zombies.  It all sounds fantastic.

If there was any problem with Left 4 Dead it would be that it's a drag to play by yourself.  The multiplayer experience is what most gamers ought to take home from Left 4 Dead.  Unfortunately you don't get that same sense of adrenaline from the single player experience.  It just isn't all that fun.

In the end Left 4 Dead is an amazing game and an amazing experience.  There are few games that are as good as this or as amazingly fun and adrenaline pumping.  Even those who don't normally like first person shooters can come to Left 4 Dead and enjoy it.  So jump on in and try to survive.

It's like playing a saturday morning cartoon, except it has a lot of content kids won't get. The game starts with Mao, who wants to defeat his father the Overlord, because his father ruined his video game system(sound familiar?) that cost him millions of hours worth of data. And so our quest begins. The voice overs sound like something off of Fox Kids saturday morning shows.

The game offers so many little things to do and manage. I was actually quite intimidated by the options it gave me when I started playing because I was pretty clueless. After some experimenting I'm slowly understanding parts of it. It is an srpg, but it is like no other srpg I've ever played. The levels are usually small and offer some traps, and puzzles as you traverse the area. I have a feeling this game is going to offer me a lot of great hours. There's so much to upgrade and different things to do.

The combat is pretty much the same as the other Arkham games, in that it's really smooth and makes you feel like a total badass when you get a long combo. The ""boss"" fights are pretty fun and each one has a different approach so they force you to think in a different way with each new boss.

The only real downside I can think of is the map system, the map screen is very basic and not very intuitive. I spent a lot of time wandering back and forth trying to figure out where I should go, perhaps it's just that I had a hard time with it but I feel like it could have been handled a bit better.

5.0,False,"09 25, 2008",A3O5JXIMC4LR,B00005ME6O,James J. Schultz,"Hardly a game at all, really.  Silent Hill 2 is an experience before a game--a happening in stead of a distraction.  It's an event to be felt rather than played.  That's what Silent Hill 2 is for me.  And it's amazing.  In general, I'm not a fan of horror games.  But the Silent Hill series is more than cheap scares and gore (though such will be found).  It's a great story tied with exploration and discovery.  It's the unraveling of secrets.  What happened?  What's going on?  What's it all mean?  These are the questions you'll be asking yourself when you play through SH2.  Or SH3 for that matter.  I assume the same goes for 1, 4, Origins, and the new 5, but since I haven't played them I cannot say absolutely.

James Sunderland's wife passed away three years ago, but he could swear the letter he's holding is written in her handwriting.  She's waiting for you, James, in your ""special place"".  But when James finds the old resort town, he finds only monsters and those few humans dragged to the town, driven by their own inner pain, trying to discover things for themselves.

James searches, fighting where he must, being stalked by the malevolent figured with the helmet shaped like a rust-covered pyramid that carries a knife too big for a normal man to even lift.  He searches through streets and apartments, a park, a hospital, a prison, but will James find the answers, or will he go mad, or is he already?  This is Silent Hill 2.

The gameplay is what you'd expect if you'd played the games before.  You run around, solve puzzles, beat up monsters with a steel pipe or shoot them or what have you.  You uncover secrets and watch the events unfold.  And how you play the game determines how it ends.  Explaining a game like Silent Hill is boring when you mention the mechanics.  Because the mechanics--the controls--are just there for you to have a way to be in the story.  The controls work, that's all that needs to be said about them.  Camera angles can be irritating at times, but they are how they are to increase the cinematic quality.

Overall, though, Silent Hill 2 is amazing.  I wasn't even a fan until very recently.  I picked up 3 wondering if I liked horror games.  I still don't know if I do, but I love Silent Hill.

Graphics - Decent, most of the times.  Great during some cut scenes.  But we're spoiled to amazing next-gen graphics these days.  Still, I love the facial expressions on characters during the well-rendered scenes.  That really brought life to the characters.

Sound - Fantastic.  Akira Yamaoka has been doing SH's music for so long and for good reason, it's always fitting with the mood.  Catchy, haunting, whatever.  I'll be buying the soundtrack.

In closing, I've played more fun games than SH2, but I don't think any will stick in my mind as well or as long.  It will make you think, it will make you wonder, and you'll enjoy it the whole way.  And really, isn't that what games are supposed to do?",Don't go to Silent Hill without a clean conscience.,1222300800,,,

Using this tool did take four hours to download, but you can download it to as many computers as you want! I have Civ IV complete on my desktop and laptop and have so far had no hassle playing on either system.

Now, to talk about the seperate expansions.

Civ IV: This is the original game, the basic one. In this game you can control a civilization from the dawn of man (stone age) all the way to... well... however long it takes to win! This game features only gameplay on the planet Earth. If you win or lose by any victory, it gives you the option to continue playing until you give up, or your entire civ was destroyed. This is the basis for the expansions.

Civ IV colonization: Drastic reproduction of the game. The earlier Civs were focused on warfare, Colonization is focused on growth. You control either the Spanish, Dutch, or English colonies as they trade goods and prosper. It is a race to see who can break away from the motherland first. Among other features in this game, you can take any citizen out of a city and go found a new one. You can store, load, or manufacture goods and have them shipped wherever you like. You can trade with the motherland for immigrants, goods, or items of warfare.

Civ IV Beyond the Sword: This game is much like the original in many ways of gameplay. Many new concepts are introduced. New mods, new techs, new civics, even random things can happen to you or your city. Ex: ""Sire, a wildfire has destroyed many trees around your capitol (Coruscant.) How would you like to continue? 1: Good, I was planning to cut it down anyway (do nothing.) 2: Oh no, that is terrible (fund reforestation efforts. 134 gold) 3: A fire? Who is responsible!? (do something else...)
Included in this game is a mod called Final Frontier. I personally have fallen in love. It is a variation of Civ gameplay that lets you explore the vastness of space. You get a whole new tech tree, new civs, new units, and can colonize star systems. In a star system you can play as if it were a city, but you can build on every individual planet!

Civ IV Warlords: I haven't played much, but from what I have seen, new techs, new civs, and a few scenarios are included in this expansion.

Even though newer and probably better games are on the horizon to claim the  #1 spot due to technology advancements- Half-Life will likely forever hold  my fondest gaming memories.
In my opinion, Starcraft was the first game  to have truly amazing online support. Including quick and easy updating,  ease in finding fast games, and a constant stream of new maps and game play  variations to keep it interesting. Half-Life with Won.net was the first  game to bring that kind of support to fans of first-person fragging. Single  player was great, but once you visit the online Half-Life community... kiss  your other hobbies goodbye. I praise valve for creating this game- quite  possibly my favorite of all time. Never has a FPS had such amazing weapons,  and well-tuned multiplayer maps. Thanks to won.net, finding on-line games  have been a snap with filters to find exactly what you are in the mood for  and a fast connection.
Like Starcraft again, Valve constantly released  free maps, and variations including Team Fortress Classic- a whole other  game in itself, which quite frankly deserves a five-star rating of its own.  With 9 unique classes, and goals more detailed then simply ""killing"", TFC  added cunning and strategy to a gaming genre that previously relied on  reflexes and the memorizing of maps. It truly feels as though you are on a  team in fierce competition. This game is a sport.
To top it off,  Half-Life gamers themselves were able to make their own maps, character  skins and mods- propelling this game and its community into unbeatable  longevity.  It has been more than a year and a half since this game has  come out, and still new FPS games are hard pressed to mimic its appeal.  Even though everyone must know its reputation by now, I feel obligated to  pay tribute to this amazing game.
It will be interesting to see if any  game will ever be able to match its popularity. My money is on Valve's next  game, Team Fortress 2.",Highest Praise,952041600,12,,

5.0,False,"04 18, 2012",A8CPQ7D8WSK2,B000GHWQUY,Clever Name Goes Here,"I owned a Sega CDX back when it first came out in 1994. I was just a young teen, and I saved and saved to get this thing, which was a staggering $399.99 USD when it first launched-and that was in 90's dollars, which if you crunch the numbers, that is a lot of money...
Anyway, I did not regret it. As a kid, and at that time, I think I probably did not fully realize how neat this was. I certainly enjoyed it at the time though, and it was worth the money, even if some of that value came through the sheer novelty.

A few notes about the unit- Sega promoted this as a multi-function system, which indeed it is. They even went as far as to claim it works as a portable CD player. It has a compartment for two ""AA"" batteries; they slide in behind the cartridge slot, and will power the unit during audio CD playback. It does work, but even when I was a kid, I knew it was silly to think of carrying this thing around as a CD player; though it is small (a little smaller than the Nintendo Wii), it is not quite that small, and it is heavy for its size.
The build quality is great though, as all of the Sega made Genesis units were.

Other notes about the design-some accessories are not compatible. Certain controller accessories, such as an wireless infrared system Sega made (which you would not want to use anyway...) will not work since the CDX has non-standard controller port spacing, with one on each side of the front plate instead of next to each other. Also, since they where pushing to make this thing tiny, concessions where made to get all the connectors in here. The AC adapter plugs into the back, as you would expect, but the A/V cable plugs into the right side of the unit, which it really strange. In retrospect, I find this just adds to the system's strange allure, but it is not very aesthetically appealing or practical when placing it on a shelf. The CDX adapter is also a monster, providing a somewhat humorous contrast to how tiny the system is.
The CD door is delicate, though not at all overly fragile; it is just small and thin and is only as strong as something this size can be.

When you turn the system on for games, the small LCD on the front glows a pale orange, which is neat. This LCD does not light up when you play audio CD's off of battery power. The little window in the top lets you see if there is a disc in the drive, and the top front of the unit is lined with controls for audio CD playback.

The original pack ins for the CDX include one of Sega's excellent 6-button controllers, a stereo composite A/V cable, the giant AC adapter, and three Sega CD games.
These games, by the way, are unique. They are a copy of ""Sega Classics Collection"", a precursor to the great ""6-Pak"" later released on the Genesis (which is better, since it included Sonic the Hedgehog), ""Ecco the Dolphin"", and the cult classic ""Sonic CD"".
It should be noted, that these pack in games have special packaging unique to the CDX, with jewel case sized plastic and cardboard cases, rather than the large Sega CD cases as with the retail versions. Also, for some inexplicable reason, Sonic CD has its own case, whereas the other two discs share a double sided case.
Also, note that Sonic CD has a unique label print that differs from the normal retain version; a single color pink label, instead of the blue one from the ""regular"" version, making these copies rarer. So in case you seriously want to collect this in original condition, keep this in mind.
Sega never released a stand-alone CDX without the games, since the cheap-to-manufacture discs helped to offset the then expensive CDX hardware manufacturing costs, and make the price (more) reasonable to buyers.

One other note- I cannot fully confirm this, but in my experience, not all Sega CD games worked on my unit, specifically, Jurassic Park CD would freeze and was unplayable. I am not sure if there are hardware issues/variations that caused this, but it is worth noting. Also, the Sega 32X is not -officially- compatible. It seems the FCC would not approve it for use with the CDX due to how prone the unit was to tipping over, and also since users could not open the CD door with the 32X attached. I actually asked Sega if a solution was coming, and I got the impression from their response that perhaps a spacer of some type may have been in the works (this is pure conjecture on my part)... of course all this came crashing down as Sega's bloated hardware catalog got narrowed down to just the Saturn very soon after this time.

The CDX is a true curiosity, but it is also a great piece of hardware. If you want a Genesis/Sega CD combo, this is the best way to go, both from a practical standpoint, and for plain 'ol cool factor. The CDX, to me, is a reminder of that era where Sega was a huge name in hardware, and when strange ideas like this actually had a chance of being made. The CDX is a great, rare piece of Sega history, and totally worthwhile to Sega collectors!",A great piece of Sega history,1334707200,6,,

The White console specifically: beautiful is the best way to describe it, its a very stark and clean color but the black accents really make the unique shape of the PS4 pop. I also find the finish of the plastics to be better on the white models then the black.

5.0,False,"10 27, 2009",APZC5PRJVM0PY,B000WMEEB2,JD,"I have followed Borderlands for years.  I first saw it probably three years ago in a gaming magazine and it grabbed my interest then.  The final product has changed some, but I have to say I love where they have gone with it.

Like some I was worried about the graphics prior to playing the game.  Now that I've played it though I think they match the atmosphere of the game and I love them.  They lend another dimension to the atmosphere of the game and this game has a lot of atmosphere.  It really is a game that focuses on the fun, with lots of humor sprinkled in, tons of guns with big explosions and enemies that explode beautifully and run around yelling curses at you.  True to the advertising there are thousands and thousands of guns here.

The game plays like a first person shooter with a hint of RPG elements thrown in.  There is loot to pickup but it is all money, guns or ammo.  And that is fine because you won't want to spend all your time looting when it is so fun to shoot.  There are 4 classes to pick from, but aside from having a unique action skill their customization doesn't add any additional abilities and they can all use all of the guns you come across (the skill points you spend are focused on adding damage to certain gun types or boosting your ability to take certain types of damage).  This lets you pick the character you want to play and still play them your way.  Want to snipe with the big guy, go for it.  Want to blow things away with the Siren.  You can.  I wish there were more diversity in the skills you can upgrade, but I can understand why they kept it simple.  Don't fix what already works so well.

Like all first person shooters this one can get a little monotonous at times, but I have to admit they have done an excellent job keeping you interested.  You won't find a lot of different enemy models, but the enemies will behave differently and use different weapons and attacks on you, and there is a lot of diversity in how, and with what weapons, you go about gunning them down.  The gunning is just so dang enjoyable that I can shoot bandits for hours without getting bored.  The use of elemental damage (either from your guns, your skill points, or from barrels found sprinkled around the enviroment) is done well and used a lot.  If you find yourself struggling on a hard boss look for a barrel of corrosive poison or combustible fuel to blow up, or equip a shocking or exploding weapon and go to town.

While the single-player is loads of fun the co-op is even better.  You can group with up to 4 friends, and when you join a game you have the choice of using a default character or importing one of your own saved game characters.  If you use your own then the loot and experience is saved.  And the game also allows you to play any character you want, so if you all want to be Brick you can.  While grouped like this the enemies will scale up in strength and difficulty and drop better loot to keep things challenging and rewarding.  My only complaint with the mutliplayer is that you can't play split screen on your xbox and still join a game over xbox live with your friends.  I don't know why they don't let you do that, but I can live with it.  But it would have been fun because my wife plays split screen with me, but can't join me when I play with my other friends.  Boo!

My final verdict for Borderlands is 5 stars, and I rarely give a game 5 stars.  If you are thinking about getting it I say get it.  This game is great fun and even after you think you are done with it, it is fun to pick it back up and just go gun down some more bandits or skaggs.  Boom!

I didn't try multi-player yet, I only played the demo, so if you're looking for a review on multi-player, don't read this. If you've played the first Uncharted, then you're not going to have trouble with this--the controls are almost exactly the same. The storyline is as intriguing as you'd imagine. I'm glad they kept the Dragon Sniper and the Wes, and they even threw in some new guns. The M32 Hammer (I think that's what it's called) is sweet and the RPG 7 is great if you have a lot of enemies crowded together. I found the parts with the helicopters and the tanks a bit frustrating, but I got over it. There are much more challenges (in my opinion) in this than in the first--and I mean shooting-wise. They still kept the puzzles that barely require any logic at all. All you need is Nate's journal to solve them. There's still plenty of action and some hilarity. It's a lot like the first, and I'm beginning to think Naughty Dog can pull anything off--and a game with extremely high expectations because of its prequel is pretty hard to pull off.

The violence that Lee displays in his movies are so extreme, so grosteque, that even todays action heroes wouldn't even dare to perform that kind of stuff. Even if someone tries to emulate his violence, it wouldn't be as good looking as Bruce Lee's original violent performances. Even if he died a tragic death in '73, his memories are still alive today. You'll see a whole lot of people with Bruce Lee T-Shirts, cartoon characters trying to be like Bruce Lee, remastered DVDs of Bruce Lee classics, and even some video game characters in a fighting game acting, fighting, and sounding like Bruce Lee. Now it's time to remember Bruce Lee in another way...put him a next-gen video game console with the greatest 3D graphics processor of all time, the XBox ! Enter Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon, the first Bruce Lee title to feature 3D technology and real time combat. And it's the most anticipated action game among an audience of young Bruce Lee fans. Now to describe the game. The graphics are perfect, powered with the XBox's ultimate 3D processor. The 3D models look very superb with no graphical flaws ! The lighting effects, including the flaming fist mode, looks absolutely jaw dropping. And as for the stages, they're huge and good looking ! There are not much flaws on these stages, except for the fact that there's a whole lot of fog and tons of it. But still, this is a graphical powerhouse overall, and the cutscenes rock ! The audio is okay...I guess. The voice actor who did Bruce Lee didn't do that much of bad job. They almost sound identical, but he really needs to work on it more, including that yell that Bruce Lee does (you know...WAAAAATAAAAAHHHH !!!). And some of the other voice actors are rather laughable, but on the plus side, it almost sounds like they're featured in a Kung-Fu movie. So that seems fair ! The music sounds perfectly fit with the traditional Chinese Kung-Fu tunes. And the sound effects are blazing with realistic hitting and grunting. If you listen carefully, it sounds very identical to that of one of the sound effects featured in one of his films. And as for the gameplay, it rocks ! The controls really hit the spot with slick movement and fast control response. The in-game combat will seem a bit clunky to some newcomers, but after playing this a couple of times, you'll really get used to it. And the coolest thing about the gameplay is, when you kill the last enemy, you get a slow motion of your enemy falling down after one fatal blow and you get to use Nunchakus on certain stages. My favorite part of the game ! The only thing that bothers me about the gameplay is the unforgivable camera angles. It keeps on moving everytime you're done duking it out with the last batch of thugs or if you're fighting with one enemy. But still, even with those flaws, I really loved playing this game. Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon is one of my favorite XBox titles among everything else. Many people may not enjoy it, but anyone who still enjoys watching Bruce Lee's films and still looks up to him, will definently like this game ! If you want to see Bruce Lee alive and kicking it...literaly, Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon is the title that Bruce Lee fans should never miss !",The legendary Bruce Lee makes a big scene on the XBox !,1025740800,7,,

In this one you are required to play the game through 3 different paths. You get to play the game as either Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli as they go off on their own battle , then you have to play the game as Gandalf as he goes through his own wizard path and then finally you have to defeat the game as the Hobbits Sam and Frodo! Each of the 3 different paths all end up at the same place in the end and the journey that gets you to the end is unforgettable. The Graphics are to die for and the voice-overs and Sound Effects are excellent too. My favorite part about this game is that there are so many complex things going on around you in the background as you play. For example: when you are in the first level that you play as Sam and Frodo you are running through this blown-up castle and there's bricks and fire and smoke everywhere. And as you are running around killing the enemies you see the Dragon flying by in the sky and you see pieces of brick and buildings crumbling at your feet and all around you. The only gripe I have about this game is the same one I had about Two Towers. And that is that even on Easy it is a very difficult game and it's also very dark all the time too. After an hour of playing my eyes and hands hurt so bad because of all the darkness and the thousands of enemies that attack you at every turn. You do have to do a ton of fighting, it gets tedious and stressful at times, but once you beat the level you feel as if you earned the victory.

I just couldn't deal with it. I get the gist of what happens in it (MGS4 helps alot) but that's besides the point.

The second game was very exciting and intense: like sneaking around guys and escaping if caught. And the guys you disable don't disappear! You actually have to like stuff them in lockers or unoccupied rooms. Very realistic for a ps2 game. The graphics are smooth but not the best I've seen.

The third game is the stand out of the collection: you can do everything along the same lines of the second game and more! You actually have to survive the rugged jungle while sneaking around guys and disabling them against all odds. By meaning of surviving I mean you have to take care of yourself throughout the game: You have to consistantly eat over time or after a battle because you'll wear down, affecting your aiming and your gut will growl giving your position away when your to trying to sneak! You also have to watch what you eat because the food you kill or gather over time can go bad and give you food poisoning! You also have to medicate yourself if you are poisoned. You also have to pull bullets and arrows out where you were hit and mend them. You even have to mend broken bones! Simply left me awe struck.

But where the heart of all these games lie is in the storyline. These aren't just your typical everyday games. Every one of these games have an in depth story that immediately pull you in and unfold over time like a giant book across all 4 games. And they stay with you for a while even after playing them.

Not to mention the 16 FREE DLCs they will be releasing; very impressive indeed. The creators made it clear they care about my business, unlike many big AAA game companies. Anyway below is my take on the pros and cons.

*Pro's:
-Huge open world, great graphics, lush vivid colors, cool crafting feature, tons of missions/quests, many unique enemies, incredible detail & textures, beautiful dynamic weather, movie style cinematic dialog exchanges, true freedom to explore, gorgeous scenery, hypnotizing music, very funny humor, lots of blood, thrilling combat with cool abilities, 36 different end-game save-states with multiple endings, and so much more.
-The dialog option you select can ENTIRELY change the outcome of that particular situation, and the outcome of the story.
-You don't need to have played the other Witcher titles to enjoy or understand this one, I know because this was my first Witcher game.
-Game of Thrones style drama.
-The music is seriously so good!
-The horses are actually fast, much faster than the mounts on Dragon Age: IN.
-Upgrade your horse.
-Sail on a small boat.
-You can save your game at any time and there's unlimited save slots.
-Color blind friendly option was added/patched in.
-Stash spot was added/patched in.
-New game plus (NG +) feature was patched in.
-Very different difficulty levels.
-Vast amount of content.
-The optional card game ""Gwent"" is the best mini-game within a game that I've ever played. There are 4 different playable decks with unique leader cards. It's very addictive and you can collect cards from random vendors throughout the world.

*Con's:
-Enemies can either be extremely difficult or very easy.
-Fall damage is bonkers, but you can press ""O"" to barrel roll as you land to reduce the damage.
-You are forced to use your ""Witcher Senses"" in the majority of quests, can get a bit annoying. *Thankfully they patched in a color blind option that helps me see the red spots easier.
-You will light/extinguish candles and lanterns on accident, all the time.
-You can only fast travel from road signs, not a big deal but there it is.

I want to proudly add that I have NOT experienced any serious issues, glitches, or frame rate problems while playing The Witcher 3.

Overall this game is absolutely amazing and will provide tons of fun for a very long time.

I'm a huge fan of the Bond games, and we have all of the previous ones. We got this one as soon as it came out, and were definitely not disappointed!
The graphics are a huge step up from previous versions. In the first 'training' mission, you're driving a car through city streets. The lights reflect off of the curves of the car, you can see inside to all of his controls and movements, the dents show up realistically, the back up lights glow softly, and if you bash it a bit, the trunk comes loose. The city around you has cobblestone streets, water rippling, streetlights that come down when you hit them. The attention to detail is just amazing!
As you then move on through the various levels, you see this same level of detail everywhere. From the Austrian castle and other alpine scenes, to the city scenes, watery scenes and more, each really shines.
The plot is very engaging and typically Bond. But in an attempt to show that this isn't about violence - he's a SPY after all, not a Rambo - you get bonus points for being stealthy instead of blasting in with guns, and for stunning or capturing enemies instead of killing them.
In fact, just about every area can be 'accomplished' in many ways. Bluster your way into an objective by a full frontal assault ... or sneak in the side way for extra points. Since you're also rewarded for your time and health, often the sneaky, non-violent way is the best.
You've got a huge array of equipment, weapons, armor and vehicles, and all work just the way you'd expect them to. I found the default controller configuration REALLY annoying, but a quicks stop in the config area got it back to the way I'm used to playing.
Plus, there's multiplayer! Play with up to four people at once on REALLY great maps with quite a bit of customization options on each one. Grab some bots for practice, and play arena, team arena, king of the hill, capture the flag, or other game types.
Definitely worthy of the Bond series, and highly, highly recommended to any first person shooter fan!",Incredibly fun with great graphics,1038096000,23,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It isn't as bad as the previous ones and has more to look forward to and tons of extras.  There are many 'apps' to obtain, from a berry app that lets you know your berries are ripe, to a step counter and even one that lets you view how your pokemon are in the daycare center.  At least you can obtain many different kind of berries for free, from 3 people in 3 different towns.

The graphics are not much better, but more so than previous games.  It is fun to use the stylus to battle, find items in your 'bag' and the like.  At least on the bottom screen, one can 'click' on the 'bag' where said item is.  That is a good improvement over the other way.

I am very dissappointed with the ""Safari Zone"" or more properly put ""Safari Swamp""--thats right a swamp.  Very hard to move around in it as you often get trapped up to your nose in a 'pit' and not many rare pokemon in it as well.

At least money isn't a problem, as there is a dueling pair that have a ""Chatot"" and a ""Roselia"".  With ""luck Incense"" or ""Amulet Coin"" on one of your Pokemon, one can literally rack up 24k each time you battle both.

There are an occasion, walking through walls glitches, especially when coming out of the rooms from trading, chatting, etc., in the poke centers.

Prey 2017 takes heavily from the System shock series (the predecessor to bioshock) down to having a code from that original game. It however uses the nearly 20 years of gameplay advancements since that game and this game  to make something that much like doom last year is both something new and interesting while making it fun and retro.

It starts off very much as the typical sci-fi horror game with your character, which you pick whether you'll be playing a male or female, as apart of a space station and witness something that makes you know things gone side ways and aliens have taken over everything. But then it takes a step to the left and challenges you with a few ideas and offers you choices, and not just ""clearly right and clearly wrong"" choices but ones that dip into the shades of gray. You can leave someone to die who is telling you it's okay if you do just as long as you complete the mission, You can make someone who was there to kill you and everyone else on station change their minds with a form of brainwashing. But you can also find a way to save the first person and kill the second person without a second thought. It's up to you, though know one secret ending will give you an idea of what's really going on while not giving everything else away.

The Aliens themselves are a rather interesting mix of things but all at their core is a mass of shadowy materials that can deform and transform. At first these can make walking into a new room a nightmare as several objects may be in fact the basic mimic enemies in disguise. But later can become a nuance as one directly is effected by how many powers you use to use your upgrades on, while another is all about corrupting and hijacking machines such as turrets and even some doors, and another is all about attacking you and your fellow human's minds. These enemies all require different approaches depending on their weaknesses, what you specialize in and how you want to use your ammo.

As discussed above there are specialization and powers, these come from nueromods which as the name suggest modify your character's brain. These can do everything from allow you more equipment slots, to upgrade your weapons, to throwing things or jumping around like the incredible hulk , turn into objects much like the mimic enemies and even blast several elemental or psychokinetic energies at enemies. All of which have their uses outside of normal combat as well as inside: If there's a door way that requires level 3 strenght, you can forgo that by finding a vent shaft or climbing the pipes.

The game is at very least 15+ hours on your first play through  if you don't rush and try to do things here and there. The only real complaints I have are load times being long and the rare ""Wait what?"" bug (Example: I saved a character, but they for some reason suddenly became aggressive though I made sure NEVER to harm them.). However it doesn't take away from the story nor the characters who I felt were more human than most games that try to bulid a world because they weren't just ""clearly good"" and ""clearly bad"" with rare exception.

The co-op experience in my opinion is very nice (and rare for a story-based game like this). This way if two people are together, you don't have one person just sitting there only watching (which isn't that bad since its very cinematic). The only complaint I heard about the co-op experience is that the player controlling Aiden doesn't get as many opportunities to interact as the main playable character. While I would have to agree overall, I'd recommend simply swapping controllers with your co-op friend if he/she is getting a little bored. That way both players get to experience interacting with both playable characters anyway. Don't forget that the main character can manually summon Aiden (the 2nd player) at almost any point in the game, and his powers/view can make it easier to find clues or important things to interact with. So it's not completely the game's fault if the main character doesn't give the 2nd player more opportunities to play.

If you've played similar story-based games, like Heavy Rain or Until Dawn then you'll feel right at home.

Me and my friend played it from start to finish in 3 days binge playing several hours each day.

If you've never played it before, it's completely worth buying. However if you've already beat it once, it's the kind of game you'll probably never replay.",This game is an amazing story-based game,1452902400,3,,

It's certainly the most violent game on the 360 - definitely not for kids! But that's a bonus in my book. This game is built from the ground up for the hardcore gamer, for sure!

That said, I have to agree with most of the other reviewers here. I loved Ninja Gaiden Black, so I had high hopes for Ninja Gaiden 2. And while it is still a spectacular game, there are a few glaring flaws where it just comes up short. So lets get those out of the way first, shall we?

THE BAD THINGS:

1. A nonsensical story. I'm sorry, but none of the story really makes any darn sense. Especially when compared to the first game. All the story boils down to is just a flimsy excuse to string a bunch of unrelated levels together. So don't pay much attention to it. Also, I thought Ryu's whole family was dead. Was that not established in the first game? Again, you just gotta ignore this stuff and enjoy the game for what it is. The game is about ACTION. Forget everything else!

2. Too many bland environments. While enemies are lavishly detailed, the environments are often hit and miss. Some are quite beautiful. But then in the very next one you are walking down some drab hallway or cave that looks like something straight out of a PS1. Seems like the environments in NGB were a lot more detailed. They at least had a lot more thought put into them. There was a lot of climbing and 3D thinking involved. Not in this game.

3. Bad instructions. The manual is bare bones, which is fine. But I wish I had had some explanation of how to use Ninja Cinema at least. I finally figured out how to download some of the videos from the people on the leaderboard, but I still can't figure out how to upload videos. It always says, ""You are not ranked on this leaderboard"". What the heck does that mean? I AM ranked! I may be ranked 6,999 out of 7,000 but by God, I'm still ranked!

4. Slowdown. Yes, there is some slowdown, which I found surprising. This game pushes the Xbox to the limits it seems. That's all well and good until the action mounts up. In reality this rarely happens though. Just enough for you to notice it on occasion. After a while, you don't notice it at all.

5. Limited wall jumping. This is big for me. In NGB, one of the most important fighting techniques was wall jump attacks and spamming Flying Swallows. Not in this game. It seems they have tried to penalize players like me by taking almost all climbable surfaces away. It especially becomes noticeable in the Trial challenges and the boss battles. Like it or not, you're pretty much ground-bound.

6. No story in mission mode. Mission mode is great, but it is Xbox Live DLC, so you'll have to buy it separately. I didn't mind that at all, and it is definitely worth the money. But while Mission Mode from NGB contained a complete mini-story toward the end, you won't find anything like that here. It's fairly bare-bones.

7. Glitches. My game froze two or three times. No big deal, but still annoying. Especially once when it was right at the end of finishing a level, and I had to do it over again. What a bummer.

8. Way too linear. Unlike NGB, NG2 has virtually no exploration. That game had more open levels and lots of places where you had to think in three dimensions. Here, you're just level grinding from one hallway to the next. And while taking all the thought out of it does let you just concentrate on the fighting, it's still kind of annoying. You would think game developers would be better at this by now.

9. No unlockables. This is a big one for me. The Xbox Ninja Gaiden included all 3 NES games as unlockables. NGB included the Arcade game. This game has got NOTHING. That is totally inexcuseable! Expecially considering how cheap and easy it is to incorporate that old source code. Maybe this is because the game was produced through Microsoft, not Techmo. I don't know why, but whatever the reason, it leaves me feeling irritated. This game should have had SOMETHING, dang it! IMO, it should have had all four!

10. DLC Skins. What the heck? In NGB, skins were an unlockable reward for being an awesome player. But now you have to pay for them through Xbox Live! How annoying is that? It just further underscores the ""no unlockables"" problem.

11. Too much boobage. Yeah, yeah... I know a lot of guys will disagree with me here. But I've gotta say, I honestly do NOT like seeing every female in these games depicted with double-D size breasts! There. I said it. The giant cleavage is distracting. It's annoying. And frankly, it's demeaning to women. A real woman - one who was capable of the gymnastics that the female heroines do in these games - would likely have so little body fat that she would have hardly any breasts at all. I know, I know... this is only a game. We're not trying to be realistic here. But is it really necessary for game developers to treat all women like nothing more than sex objects? I just can't stand how Team Ninja does this, and they do it in all their games. (Get real, guys! Stop treating your game audience like we're all super-horny teenage boys.)

THE GOOD THINGS:

1. Cool villains. I liked the enemies in this game. They were varied, and all pretty fun to play against. Yeah, some were cheap. But what would a NG game be without enemies taking cheap shots?

2. More blood and increased carnage. It ain't rated ""M"" for nothing, baby! This game is VIOLENT. A LOT more violent than the first one. Blood spews and sprays, body parts fly, and heads roll. Definitely not a game you want to buy for your 8 year old nephew. It's tons of fun, though :)

3. Obliteration techniques. You've still got Ultimate techniques, which look cool as ever. But now you also have the finishing moves, called Obliteration techniques. These are easy and fun to pull off, and sweet to watch.

5. Interesting new weapons. I liked most of the new weapons. It has some really neat ones, like the Kusuri-gama, which is chain-and-sickle affair. And the Eclipse Sycthe, which is somewhat similar in execution to the Dark Dragon Blade, or the Unlabored Flawlessness. (That weapon rules. Once you find it, you pretty much have no need to use any other weapon ever again.) Some weapons from NGB are missing and some make a return, like the Lunar Staff. I did miss the Nunchucks, but the Tonfa make up for that somewhat.

6. Awesome new Ninpo. I disagree with others here who say that the new Ninpo is worthless. I think they are all pretty neat, and awesome to use. I found each one suited to specific situations, and used them all. Art of the Inferno is still a fave, of course. But Art of the Piercing Void has its uses too. Also, the new screen effects for Ninpo use are beautiful - they are a VERY nice addition! The ninpo has to aimed now, but so what? If anything, that at least adds a LITTLE skill to it :)

7. A long game. It is not short, so you do get your money's worth.

8. A good camera. Unlike others, I have no complaints about the camera. It usually put me where I wanted to be. Only tricky part was on the rope climbs, but no biggie.

9. Mission Mode. This is super-fun and well-worth its price as Xbox Live Downloadable Content. It includes 24 missions. Of those, 16 are ""Karma Attack"" missions and 8 are ""Survival"" missions. All are super-hard and challenging. In Survival, you are given a unique weapon with which to face unending waves of enemies, with your goal to rack up enough karma before dying to get the medals. There is 500,000 for Steel, 1,000,000 for Bronze, 1,500,000 for Gold, and finally, the Ultra-HARD-to-get 2,000,000 karma for Gold! It is a TON of fun, if you enjoy that kind of thing.

10. Leaderboards. It's fun to see where you rank with your friends on the leaderboards. It is quite astonishing to see how much karma some of the top players have. Those guys must play the game 16 hours a day, every day.

11. Ninja cinema. This too was a nice addition, once you figure it out. It allows you to record clips of yourself. It is best used during boss fights or during Mission Mode, where you can replay your victory afterwards to feel that rush again (only a little more relaxed this time!). It is fun to watch yourself play, and enjoy seeing how awesome a player you are :) The classic cinema filter was nice, too.

12. Xbox Live Achievements. These are always fun, no matter what game. And NG2's do not disappoint.

13. Bone-crushingly difficult. This could be good or bad, depending on your point of view. I thought the first half of the game was super-easy. But then the difficultly level suddenly ratcheted up to unbelievable proportions. Toward the end of the game, I honestly felt like throwing in the towel. I mean, all the never-ending multiple boss fights with no save stations start wearing on your nerves after a while. And when you are dying OVER and OVER, it gets a little disheartening sometimes. But I hung in there. And with the help of youtube, I made it through. Now I've walked the Way of the Warrior, and beaten all the Missions too! ""Yeah, that's nothing,"" some of you may say. Well, you are better than I then, my friend! This game is HARD. I mean, punch you in the stomach and knock you out HARD!

THE CONCLUSION:

The game does have a few flaws. Some parts feel a little rushed, like they could have worked on some stuff more but they just ran out of time. But the fighting is polished.

And really, I just can't talk about this game without comparing it to Ninja Gaiden Black. Ninja Gaiden Black was perfection. This game is not. Great, yes. But just a little shy of perfection. Of course, If you've never played Ninja Gaiden Black, then maybe you won't even notice. Or care. In any case, I give it 4.75 stars out of 5.

It is worth buying, definitely worth playing. Nothing can quite match the awesomeness you feel when you charge up Ryu and watch him go apes--- on everyone. Will there be a Ninja Gaiden 3? I sure hope so!

Remember, Honor the Way of the Ninja!
And Peace out, Ninja dogs! Word.

5.0,True,"02 15, 2013",AB8BQ660CP12Y,B0050SVGXM,Mark D. Mather,"This is a board game, with two rule sets that take two different strategies.

Not a Mario Party, but more like a Monopoly or Game of Life, where the goal is to gain more money than anyone else and make it back to the ""goal"" bank square first.

I don't think the marketing for the game was correct, as this is not a game for the young (4-8), and slow passed that the 9-10 group might get bored with it after a few times. However for the younger gamers who are able to sit down and play the same game for an hour (or two!) should be able to enjoy and learn the various tricks that are sometimes required to beat the CPU players.

The Multiplayer gives more options to the game, letting players select the character they want, over the the single player where they are forced to use a Mii. However with the inability for the Cpu players to ""cheat"" and two people co-op playing can quickly flip the game in their favor. So the game's balance really only works when the players are not working together.

Overall the game has enough to show that it couldn't be a physical board game, and justifies as a video game, but the content and amount to do in the game never warranted a $60. This game was a good investment at $20. (I am a bit of a board game nut)",Fortune Street time well spent,1360886400,,,

If that's you, hang in to the end and I'll get you caught up.  For the rest of us who've been playing since Forza and Horizon 1, you're with me.

I'm not going to spend much time comparing to F:H, since that was 360 and much smaller.  Compared to H2, H3 is much more open-world.  And I mean that both in gameplay and in driving style.  Unlike H2 where cutting across country is often hampered by rivers, walls, and dense forest, H3 plays up its open Aussie outback feel so much that for the first few hours of play I rarely used roads outside of race events.

This is both really cool, in that bumping across the outback will rack up skill points quickly, but also something H3's AI hasn't quite figured out.  Get behind a car and challenge them, and most of the time you can quickly cut across to the destination while the drivatar meanders the winding roads.  Maybe that will get patched, or fixed as H3's system learns how people drive.

The physics are pretty sweet, and I love the off-road feel of H2's Storm Island without the annoying rain torrents.  The car lineup is what you've come to expect from Forza with the notable exclusions of Porsche and Volkswagen (sorry, no baja bug... for now).  I wasn't a big fan of how H2 sorted your garage, and H3 uses the same UI.  It is nice that any of your cars can be brought to you (for 10,000 credits), and that you can immediately jump (free) to the nearest Horizon Hub.

If you liked H2's UI and pause menu, this is pretty much the same.  I wish there was a way to skip certain radio stations, and the Groove integration for non-Groove subscribers means every time you open the Settings -> Audio menu it will complain it can't download your playlist (hopefully a quick patch).

H3 is big into horns.  Old beepers, regular blowers, or fancy tunes - your R3 (down on right stick) is about to get a workout.  You can buy all of them as a DLC add-on for $2.99 or just earn them from your skill tree.  In solo, honking your horn behind somebody tags them into your convoy, and some skills let them work for you getting extra skills points or seeking hidden items (hint: *every* bridge has a Horizon billboard to smash).  As with H2, you can also buy the Treasure Map to show all billboard locations.

H3 uses fewer Forza racing championships and more ""PR Stunts"" (everything from speed cameras to jump zones to racing a speeding locomotive).  This really plays up the arcade nature of the Horizon series that separates it from the core of Forza.  That said, any and everybody can blueprint their own championships, so this game explodes with possibility.  Don't see the event you want?  Make it.  Pretty cool.

Finally, a word on AI (drivatars).  There doesn't seem to be a lot of change from H2 to H3.  AI is good, and on the easiest levels seems slightly more competitive than the blowout wins of H2.  The only thing I've disliked is certain PR stunts, like the drift zones, are sometimes so populated with drivatars that it's difficult to achieve your goals.  Again, probably just a tweak on Turn 10's part.

So for my fellow Forza fans, bottom line: buy it!  Horizon 3 is really freaking fun.

Okay, newbies to the series, let's chat.  Forza was a race simulation series that was/is very serious.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forza-6/dp/B00SVVUOGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forza 6</a>&nbsp;is the latest installment and it's beautiful.  The core Forza series is for true race simulation, so everything from track temperature to humidity and tire pressure come into play.  Horizon is the arcade-happy sibling, using Forza's gorgeous graphics engine and vehicle renderings, but setting it in a music festival-with-street racing setting.  Want to take a Ford Focus, pop it to 4WD, bump it to 800hp, and fly through the air without worrying about killing yourself/shattering your axels on landing?  Horizon is for you.  While you can set damage to realistic, Horizon's physics and damage engine is much (MUCH!) more forgiving than Forza's.  Horizon is a series to jump, groove, and not take yourself too seriously (but, I mean, still win of course).  And it's a lot of fun, so go ahead and get it!

For newbies and old friends: I'll see you online!

----------------------------

9/26/2016 update: in the four days since launch,  a *lot* more trees have cropped up,  so maybe Turn 10 noticed noone was using roads.  Still very open and easy to cross country,  just not the sandbox it was.  You also can't just ignore the center of traffic circles any more like you could in H2.  Which is probably good.  They also seem to have throttled down the number of drivatars contesting events,  and the AI's are getting smarter,  so Turn 10's dynamic code seems to be working - which means this game will just get better and better.  Awesome job!

My only critiques (after playing for 35 hours now) is that either the petrol in Australia sucks or the mechanics do, because every car backfires All. The. Time.  Also there's no way to edit a song out of a playlist, or to remove a radio station from rotation.  Both are really audiophile things not related to gameplay, but I hope Turn 10 tweaks them in an update. Groove has had issues since launch, but Turn 10 has already committed to that fix.

1/8/2017 update - well I've logged a couple hundred hours playing and am still enamored.  Every tweak I could have hoped for has been addressed, the online community is really fun, and the Blizzard Mountain expansion is fantastic (loving it much more than Storm Island in H2).

5.0,True,"12 22, 2012",A291R54MXR0ZFL,B004K1EA5G,Dylan McGregor,"I'm a huge fan of the DOA series with the Dreamcast version being my favorite up until I got the 3DS version.

The 3DS is a complete DOA experience. The story is great and fills in the blanks from the other incarnations that consisted of little more than unexplained and very short cutscenes. While the latest Xbox 360 offering is very pretty and basically a good fighter it's no where near as good as the 3DS version. Obviously the 360 has incredible graphics and the new artwork is sublime but it still falls short compared to this gem of a DOA package, and I'm still some what in disbelief that I'm saying that but it is true.

I don't see any real cons in this game unless you don't like handheld games or fighting games, in which case you wouldn't pick this up anyway so I will just give the reasons why I think you might like this game.

Graphics: Excellent on 2D and pretty good in 3D. The 3D takes a cut in overall smoothness but you'll find yourself flipping back and forth between the two and the cut-scenes in Chronicle are fun to watch in 3D. Some people won't like the ""motion comic"" aspect of some of the cut scenes but there aren't too many of those and I don't think they took anything away from the game. Overall this game takes full advantage of this little machines power so expect good action and lots of eye candy.

Controls: Controls are excellent and easy with the 3DS using it's bottom screen to show you your characters various moves and combos while you play! In this the 3DS cannot be beat by any other DOA game, there is simply nothing better than being able to glance at your moves while playing and a simple tap of any of the buttons will bring a string of different moves. I found all the moves easy to pull off and the controls were very responsive and smooth. I highly recommend getting the Xbox shaped holder to put the 3DS in as it will maximize your experience and be easier on your hands. Note: Some of the holders do not have a headphone port and the speakers are sometimes under your thumbs which can suck, just FYI.

Sound: Slightly tinny at times but not in anyway that takes away from the game. I only play with Japanese voices so I don't really know how good the dubbing is but the Japanese voices and sound effects are top notch.

Game modes: Lots of them! I think there is enough for everyone here.

Characters: Very large cast! Someone for everyone and all of them have extensive move lists. Massive replay value especially in Arcade mode.

Unlockables: Like the good old days, before microsoft's and sony's ungodly greed scams of charging extra for characters and costumes for fight games, 3DS DOA has tons of unlockable content from extra characters, costumes, arenas, and figures. While I would have liked to have seen everyone with a lot more costumes I can't complain since I got to earn them through playing the game.

Head to head modes seem to work fine, I had no lag time when using these modes.

Extras: like with past DOA titles you can record fight sessions and watch them later if that's your thing just keep an eye on your memory card. You can pose and take 3d pictures of the various figures you unlock.

I highly recommend this game.",Best DOA yet.,1356134400,,,

My only experience was with the cheap guitars, and I just didn't like the feel of them. This Logitech Guitar is a HUGE improvement! It's well built, solid, and feels as heavy as the real thing. I found this to be much more fun to play than the plastic stuff. Yes, it does get heavy after a while, just like a real guitar would, which only adds to the feel of the game. It is pricier than the cheap stuff, but then again, sometimes you really do get what you pay for, and for this product, it's worth it.

Pros

+ Very well built
+ Feels like the real thing
+ The size is just right
+ Buttons are positioned perfectly (no accidentally hitting them)
+ Battery life must be good (I'm still on originals)
+ A Blast To Play!

Cons

- Price (It's worth it in my opinion)
- Heaviness (Some people may find the need to rest more often)

5.0,False,"03 30, 2012",A1QS6EXVGHLQQ6,B000HX1P72,HattedSandwich,"I remember this game well, i saw a review of it on xplay many years ago, when they dismissed it as a failed attempt to create a standard horror fps, with an unintelligible plot. This is mind i steered away from it but a few months later ran into it in a bargain bin at a local game store. Why not? Starbreeze studio had never done wrong by me, so i gave it a chance. One of the better choices ive made in my lifetime i must say. The game puts you in the shoes of a young hitman working for New York's most feared and established mafias, the Franchetti Family. The cinematic intro immediately immerses you into this startlingly grim world painted with striking visuals and the foreboding sense of dread that awaits. When it does, you are in for a real treat. The Darkness, a timeless monstrosity who takes the first born male of its host's family every generation, reveals itself unto you, with one of the most prominent voice overs i have ever heard. The demonic, thirsting voice commands you to kill, kill to live and kill to feed, every wicked man you devour empowers this faceless nightmare and in so doing gives it more sway over your own soul. the game is entirely story driven, as most Starbreeze games are, and the plot is beautifully written. Jackie sounds like a real ball buster, and his counterpart and love interest Jenny is the perfect foil to his street rat nature. The game is fairly long, lasting around 12 hours and takes you to many locales, each full of wonderful personalities and memorable set pieces. The best part of this game is that it rarely resorts to cheap action thrills; everything seems weighted and believable, even if you are the bearer of Death incarnate. One last thing i would like to point out is the gun play. While it has a drastically different feel than most fps games, but it has a more realistic feel, and what caught my attention is the collision detection. I never had a gun poke through a wall or body; Jackie would raise, bend his arms, or holster his weapons when i bumped into something, making me feel like he actually wielded a weapon, not a sprite.

The controller is the best that you can use for playing Super Smash Bros and easily trumps the giant Wii U pad which while great, is a bit too large when you start playing more competitively.

It is more of a puzzle-solving adventure game than anything, so don't go in expecting fast action GTA / God of War style gameplay, because you will be dissappointed. That said, it is an incredible game, but for the average gamer it requires some patience.

Last year I bought a new PS2 instead of upgrading to next gen because my original 'fat' PS2 died around '06 and there were so many great titles I missed out on. Shadow of the Colossus was on that list, so I ordered it from Amazon along with a list of other great games I had never had the chance to enjoy after my original console went kaput.

I had no idea what to expect from this game and all I knew was that it got rave reviews all over the place. I read an article praising it in Maxim when it came out and read some reviews here on Amazon and that was it. I actually avoided reading anything else about it because I didn't want any spoilers to accidentally come out before I got to play. Well, first game I played upon receiving my new PS2 was God of War and I followed it with Shadow of the Colossus. That in itself may have been a mistake because God of War is a button-mashing, enemy-packed, bloody action fest and SotC is, well, not. At all. In fact, SotC was so slow-paced by comparison that I put it away for awhile so I could come back to it later. For awhile I didn't think this game was going to live up to the hype at all.. but I could tell it was going to be a great game and I didn't want to ruin the experience by not letting myself get into it (I had to let the awesomeness of God of War wear off first, HA).

Anyway, the game has some of the best and most beautiful original design and mechanics I have ever seen in a game. The controls are very different for a third-person game and it took a lot of getting used to for me. In fact, one of my bigger complaints would have to be the controls and the control response. The game is slow-moving for my taste, but you let yourself get into it and it is a very challenging and even addicting game. There is a lot of story and exploration involved and you just have to immerse yourself in it. I'm not trying to say that this game isn't exciting and intense, because it is. It's just not the same kind of intensity that most gamers are used to. Unique sums it up pretty well. But yes, beautiful game.

Using the environment as your camouflage Snake makes his way to a small defunct post to rescue the man, but after you rescue him things suddenly turn for the worse.

Your mentor, instructor and lover, only know as The Boss, has betrayed you, using a special forces unit, called Cobras, that goes beyond the fantastic, has crossed over and defected to the Soviet Union, taking along two ""Davy Cocottes"" recoilless rifles that can fire nuclear warheads. One of these weapons is used to destroy the weapons factory; sparking massive crisis. After Snake has thoroughly been beaten the crap out of, he is quickly patch up and sent out into the field again, this time to stop a third world war. He has three objectives: Rescue the Scientist, destroy the massive machine that scientist was building (a tank that is able to launching an ICBM) and finally, kill the traitor, your mentor, mother figure, and partner in bed, The Boss.

MGS3: Snake Eater is a worthy prequel to all of the Metal Gear games, the Snake Character you play is none other then the Big Boss in the old NES games.

Some of the unique features in this game are stamina for character, you don't need to use any health packs as long as you keep your stamina up (by eating snakes...and other things), you can also perform surgery on yourself to remove bullets, fix broken bones and mending cuts.

The overall quality is unquestionably high some of the best graphics on a home game yet, ridiculously detailed environments packed with secrets, tiny jokes and optional extras, replay bolstered by collectibles and harder difficulties, and controls that you can truly master... But the story....How can i put this sucks .... I kept assuming it would get better, that the end would hold some incredible explanation that would cause everything to make perfect sense in retrospect, but it never happened. In fact, the plot just got worse and worse. piling twist onto twist until, near the end, i was literally laughing at how ridiculous it had all become.

It's infinitely more polished. more playable, more replayable, better looking and just plain fun to run around and play than most anything else out there.

5.0,False,"11 14, 2012",A11UNO37VLRI7B,B006GHA8EE,Jub Jub,"The Witcher 2 is based on the Witcher series by Andezej Sapkowski and is a well known fantasy series in Poland. Now I had never heard of the Witcher series till I saw youtube's Angry Joe review the PC version on his show so needless to say I had never played the first Witcher and wouldn't have gotten to play the sequel had CD Projekt not released the game for the Xbox 360. This is going to be a review of the 360 version since it came out this year and my PC would explode if I tried to install it on here.  I should say that I'm not that big a RPG gamer and most of the RPGs I've played in my life have been Japanese made and that was back in the 16-bit days so this was my real first time playing a Euro-RPG. What's interesting is that is the most successful video game Poland has ever made and for good reason. In May 2011, the Prime Minister of Poland gave a copy of this game to President Obama on his visit to the country. But that's enough of the history though, on to the review. I really liked this game and it really sucked me in. Now the 360 version is known as the Enhanced Edition which includes 10GBs of new content and also comes packaged with a journey book which is basically a mini players guide and the game's soundtrack which I am actually listening to as I write this review. It's really good! The game and soundtrack.

STORY: You play as Geralt of Riva, the Witcher. What is a Witcher? Witchers are mutated men that possess greater strength, speed, and agility than most humans and the use of magic. They also have animal like eyes that allow them to see in the dark. They are few and usually work as mercenaries.  The game starts with Geralt in a dungeon in a castle in the kingdom of Temeria. He is being interrogated by Vernon Roche the leader of the Blue Stripes, the Temerian Special Forces. Geralt is the only witness and believed to be the assassin of King Foltest but Geralt knows it was really another Witcher who committed the crime and other assassinations of kings in the kingdom. Through a series flashbacks, we learn of the events leading up to the assassination, about the characters, learn of Geralt's relationship with the sorceress Triss Merigold, and the attack of a dragon during the battle that took place on the day of Foltest's assassination. You then break out of the prison with the help of Vernon and Triss and head out on a quest to clear Geralt's name and find the assassin. Oh but things are not as simple as they seem. As the game progresses a massive conspiracy unfolds that could change the fate of the entire kingdom.

The world this is set in is an immersive one filled with the usual fantasy elements and races such as magic, monsters, sorcerers, elves, dwarfs, demons, ghosts, and dragons but unlike other fantasy series like Lord of the Rings per say, the world is very dark and gritty. There is strong racism in this world as humans tend to hate and mistreat non-humans. Elves are seen as bad guys, depending which path you take. That's something I've rarely seen in fantasy. This is also a VERY ADULT game. There is very strong language throughout (you will hear the word `plowing' used a lot and they are not talking about plowing a field), graphic violence, and there are sex scenes with full female nudity. You can find prostitutes and sleep with them as well as courting some of the female characters. The established relationship you have with Triss is done very well, one of the best adult romances I've ever seen in a game. There are a lot of interesting and developed characters throughout the game and tons of side quests and branching paths. It is a pretty long game, took me a couple weeks the first time to beat and about a little more than a week the second time so it's about 30+ hours depends on the quests you do. Far better than the usual 4 to 6 hour games you run into these days. Chapter 2 is the longest part of the game but the last chapter is much shorter so some might be disappointed in that. You don't have to have played the first game to understand what's happening in this one. If you like games with deep complex stories of political intrigue and lots of twists, you'd love this game's story. It's well written and well thought out.

GAMEPLAY: When you first play this, I highly suggest you got through the tutorial first. It's not the best tutorial but this is the only place you're going to have the game tell you the basics because once the game really starts, it's not going to hold your hand like most games these days. The tutorial will make the combat system seem more complicated than it really is though. You'll notice that you can be armed with two swords, a steel sword for killing humans and a silver sword for killing monsters. You have six magical spells most only two of them I used most of the time, the fire blast and the telekinetic push thing. You also have a spell that can cause enemies to turn against each other but it rarely works, a spell that boosts your defense briefly, and a magical trap that you can place on the ground that I only really used during a boss battle. The game expects you to strategize your battles, don't just run blindly into a battle or you will get your ass kicked. You gain EXP points two ways, fighting enemies and completely quests and side quests. Completing quests will give more EXP than monster fighting so you want to try and take on as many side quests as you can when you get to a new area. When you level up, you can branch out into 4 different areas, training (You'll have to fill this out first), fighting, magic, and alchemy. However, you'll mainly want to develop the fighting and magic branches more over the alchemy branch other than to get health and vigor (your magic bar) upgrades. Alchemy deals with the making of potions which there are many that you can make throughout the game and there is also a limit to how many potions you can take. You can actually OD on them which I find to be an interesting and realistic twist on potions in gaming. There are also some mini-games you can take part in such as fighting which is basically a simple QTE that is almost impossible to lose at, arm wrestling which is also pretty easy till later in the game, and some dice gambling game that I have no idea how it works so I just avoid it.

The inventory screen is a bit of a mess. When you pull it up, as default it shows you the list of everything in your inventory and you gather A LOT though out this game and will need to clean it out often as to not get weighted down. Yes, you have a weight limit and it sucks when you go over weight so sell and store items often. The map screen isn't very helpful but you do have a in game mini-map that is more much more useful. The quest management screen is also a bit confusing because you will be given so many quests that it can be hard to keep straight which quest you are trying to take on at a time. The boss battles are few but epic including an awesome battle with a dragon. One last thing I'll say is that the game has high replay value and warrants at least two play troughs as at the end of chapter 1 you will be required to choose sides and it will dramatically affect the rest of the game. Like a lot of RPGs these days you'll be required to reply and direct conversations that you have by selecting answers and this game does it very well. There have been times where I have sat there for a few minutes trying to figure out which answer I should give to an important question. Unlike Skyrim or other RPGs, there is no morality system or anything like that so in theory there is no right or wrong answers but they do weight in on the story. The conversations are engaging and very well written so don't think you'll be bored listening to all the talking that happens in the game.

GRAPHICS: The graphics are good but nowhere near as good as they are on the PC. On the PC, the environments are drop dead gorgeous, on the 360, not as much but still very good. The game recommends that you install the game on your system (that goes for both discs) to improve the graphics and load times and it does. If you don't do that, you'll be seeing almost constant texture pop in. I noted some frame rate slow down in a couple places in the game but for a game this long, it's an extremely minor issue. The character models look great and there is a lot of detail put into them and the creatures of this world. It is a very beautiful game.

SOUND: Like I said before, this game comes with the soundtrack and it is very fitting. It's beautiful and epic at the same time with a medieval, Celtic feel.  The sound design is also very good. You can walk through towns and forests hearing all kinds of life all around you. The voice acting is really good. Even just average villagers are well voiced. Geralt's voice sounds kinda like a medieval Solid Snake. Most of the voices are English and other European accents however Triss and Dandelion (your bard friend) have American voices.. They're done well but they really stand out among the European voices. All the music and sounds perfectly compliment the world the game is set in.

Overall this is one of the best RPGs I've played in a long time. It has a really good story (which is one of the most important things in an RPG in my eyes), interesting characters, a fun combat system once you get used to it, and plenty of quests. It's a long game but not impossibly long. Well worth the money for it. If you're an RPG or fantasy fan I highly suggest this game and even if you're not a big RPG gamer I suggest this game, it surprised me and I can't wait for The Witcher 3 which is currently in the works.

5.0,False,"11 24, 2010",A3OOIS6U00QJJX,B000X1PE16,Dev,"It is pretty rare for a game to be a horror game and a hit at the same time. Silent Hill 2, one of my all time favorite, was the last horror game I played and enjoyed a lot. Since then, I have been trying other games, but they just don't do it for me. Then Dead Space comes out and I give it a shot. And man, I just loved it. It has been a long time since I have played a game with such thrilling suspense horror atmosphere.

*************PROS*******************

THE SETTING: Most of the horror games (and movies for that matter) use the same idea over and over again which would be a haunted house, town or object. Not this game though. It takes place in futuristic time on a mysterious space ship missing crew. While you arrive with some company, you will soon find yourself alone walking through dark corridors, rooms with strange signs made of blood and guts etc. and have no idea what you will encounter. Want to describe more, but don't want to spoil it for you.

UNIQUE WEAPONS: You are not a soldier, but an engineer. So the weapons you use to fend off the horror you encounter are tools rather than weapons that you see in most games these days. But this is what makes the experience quite unique. Instead of mindlessly shooting enemies, you will find yourself using unique tools in very particular way to get past your foes. There are quite a few weapons in the game. They will range from circular saw blade operating guns to exploding vibration shooting devices. And ammo are fairly limited. You will get enough to kill enemies, but you will run out of them if you mindlessly waste them.

TERRIFYING ENEMIES: In most horror games, you can shoot enemies pretty much anywhere and they will die. In this game though, enemies are exceptionally designed. Not only they look terrifying and disgusting, but they will require distinct method to be defeated. In most games you go for enemy torso or heads; however, in this game you have to use your unique weapons to clip off the limbs of these monsters. If you don't they will come and get you in the most brutal way possible. Another thing you will like in terms of enemies is there are variety of them. Each will different offensive and require different approach to be killed. All enemies will utilize brutal attacks and if not taken care of swiftly punish you with a gory death. This one of the few games where I loved dying for this reason.

DECENT BOSSES: Unfortunately there are not many of them, but the few bosses this game has are quite unique. Just like common enemies, mindlessly shooting bosses will just get you killed. Again you will have to experiment will different weapons and tactics and discover what works the best.

UPGRADABLE WEAPONS AND SUIT: Another thing I loved. Killing enemies and exploring dreadful spaceship will reward you with money. This money can be used to upgrade your suit and weapons. There are tons of things to upgrade and limited money. So it requires you to choose carefully and think strategically.

SUSPENSEFUL STORY: Can't tell you much without spoiling. But there are plenty of twists. You will like it.

SPACE ENVIRONMENT: Enemies are not the only horror you are facing in the game. You are in space and part of ships are blown off. So you will also have to work through harsh conditions such as zero gravity and no air. Don't worry though. Your suit will help you thorough. I can't describe enough how wonderful job they have done making this space horror environment.

ART STYLE: This is one of the few space/futuristic games where everything feels very real. When you play the game, you actually get the feeling that this is the future, this is how it would be if you were to be on an abandoned space ship. Attention to detail is just spectacular.

REPLAYABILITY: While the game is only 10-12hr long, the experience it provides will keep you coming back for more. Plus, there are 4 different difficulty mode. If you are a completionist, it will keep you engaged for quite a long time.

*****************CONS******************

ASTROID SHOOTING: Whoever put this level in the game should be fired. If you are really good at first person shooters, you may not mind it. But as for rest of us, this level will be very torturing. This just this one part in the game where you get access to a ship turret and you are supposed shoot the incoming asteroids. If you are an average player such as myself, THE ASTROID WILL GET YOU. I hated it, just hated it. Without it, this would have been a perfect game for me.

************CONCLUSION*****************

The con I described is simply horrible. But if you try sincerely you will get past it. Other than that con, this is an amazing game and a MUST experience for lovers of third person shooter and horror genre fans.

5.0,False,"12 8, 2014",A1XDBU2KN4ZGK0,B00J48MUS4,Mike Wallace,"This is an awesome game. Quite frankly I don't understand all the bad reviews. This game is not as bad as everyone thinks.
Firstoff I like this game because there are plenty of assassination missions, both on the main storyline and sidequest wise. Secondly yes there are some glitches, but, none that are very bad and screw the game up entirely. When the very first Asssassins Creed came out on 360/PS3. there were glitches but they got better when they made more games. It is the same with this game on the next gen consoles,its the first game released on these consoles so, there are going to be alot of glitches. Call me old fashioned but, I am a single player gamer. I don't care about getting on the internet and playing co-op missions. As far as the game crashing when you get online to play co-op I don't know what all that is about. But unless online game play is that important to you can play all the co-op missions in single player. Just select the play in private option on your map when you come across a co-op mission.
As far as the game goes there are a couple of cons. Firstoff the stealth mode sucked. There are times that I can be stealthy and it works. Other times I get detected and I just go in, kick a**, and wipe out everything, which is exactly my style if I have the right weapons and equipment. I would like to note that my stealth style was based on the old Assassins Creed games. The new stealth mode they made for this game was a complete joke! Secondly the main storyline was a little hard to follow at times, especially when you assassinate someone and find out their secrets. But, the last level puts the whole thing in perspective and explains why everything happened the way it did. So, it's a minor con I would say.

First off, I use this on my Xbox 360 and on Xbox One. This headset is awesome when it comes to footsteps on Call of Duty. The sound is amazing on the Astro A40's and that is the biggest Pro of it.
The headset is extremely comfortanle and easy to adjust. You can even buy/make custom speaker tags!
Everybody says there is a problem with the mic quality on the A40's. Sure, for making a YouTube commentary is not great, but for Xbox the mic sounds just like a $20 mic, the default one which is good. Turtle Beaches have better mic quality but I am done with Turtle Beach as their X12's and X32's did not last long.
The game audio is really really awesome on the A40s and I couldn't ask for much more in a headset than what you get with this. I've wanted an A40 for years and the hype is real.
Anyways, Overall this is an awesome headset. Be sure to update your firmware when you first get this headset, though. (That involves a PC)
I really enjoy this headset and it is REALLY comfortable.  Reason for 5 stars is that it is simply a great headset besides the fact that you need to buy a headset adapter for the Xbox One, but that is not Astro's fault.","Great Sound, OK Microphone.",1422489600,2,"{'Color:': ' White', 'Edition:': ' Xbox 360 - White'}",

Now the home version has arrived, and fans of the arcade model will love it.
Like most gun games, there is a plot: you are a top secret agent who must track down the criminal syndicate bent on launching a reprogrammed satellite into orbit.  Unlike most gun games, there is a large number of cut scenes that keep the story moving along without seriously affecting game play.  Most shooting games save the cut scenes for boss battles, where CM sprinkles them throughout the game.
Also throughout the game you'll run across ""mini-games"" of sorts, where you have to use some special gadget to escape a trap or pursue your enemies.  Succeed, and the story continues ... fail, and you may have your work cut out for you to get back on track.  While hardly new to shooting games in general (and Sega shooters in particular, with House of the Dead and Lost World leading the way), these events are new to the Virtua Cop line.  (While there is no direct connection story-wise to Virtua Cop, most people consider this game to be VC3 in spy gear ... a compliment, to be sure.)
I won't spend too much time on the graphics and sound ... in true Sega style, they match the arcade system almost exactly.  Load time is practically non-existant.
As Sega knows all too well, an arcade-to-home port needs a lot of bonus goodies to bring in the sales.  Crazy Taxi had its Crazy Box, Virtua Tennis its World Circuit ... Confidential Mission is no exception.  Along with several training mini-games and a two-player ranking system that measures how well you and your cohort work together, you can unlock the Dreamcast mode (same game levels, but enemies now appear in different locations) or special gameplay options like no screen displays or level selects.
As Sega chose not to produce its own light gun for the Dreamcast, you're on your own to find one that works for you.  Supported controllers include the standard pad, the Arcade Stick and the third-party light guns.
Okay, you've got a first-class conversion and lots of new features ... what more could you ask for?  How about an incredibly low price!

It's the expansions AFTER what you get in EverQuest: Evolution that make it the most improved in my opinion. Lost Dungeons of Norrath and Gates of Discord also add ""instance"" play, where your adventuring party (you and at least 3 other players) enter a dungeon that is created at that instant (instanced) just for you. This eliminates the ""overcamped"" dungeons which tend to be what most players get angry about.
However, instead of spending $90 on Evolution and the two expansions at the outset, try this game as is - because overcamping won't be a problem to new players until they are in their latter development (L40+, usually 6 months from start). Starting cities have a good navigation help system (Ctrl+F for Find), and have ""newbie"" quests meant to help outfit your character with armor (sometimes other items as well). The game also features a crafting interface that is very helpful in reducing the ""clickfest"" that used to be required in the past.

5.0,False,"07 18, 2011",A3O1KC19TDMFV3,B000R3BN4M,Alexander Ayers,"Check out this review and others at my blog:  [...]

Kratos returns, but this time, in a prequel to his adventures which first were released on the PS2 and later re-released as part of the HD God of War Collection on the PS3, and the acclaimed God of War III.  Sony added Ready at Dawn Studios (Daxter) to help, which after playing for a while, seems like the right decision.  Originally released in 2008, this game still looks and plays great today.  Being that I have owned a PS2 and PS3 since launch, and never played a God of War title (shame, shame), and this was chronologically the first adventure, it seemed like the proper place to begin.  Does it live up to it's console predecessors?  Can a portable version of classic series make the grade?

The game opens on the shores of Attica, and Kratos is serving the Gods of Olympus, by defending the city from the attacking Persians.  Armed with his trusty Blades of Chaos attached to his arms, Kratos is thrust immediately into action, battling a combination of men, ships, and a huge basilisk.  While the battle is no easy feat, after the Persians are defeated, Kratos' adventure really begins.

Kratos happens to see the sun falling from the sky, and does what any self-respecting hero would do: investigates and signs on to retrieve it.  Following the bit of light he can see takes him to the city of Marathon, where it seems Morpheus (God of Dreams) has put the land under some dark spell.  Kratos must now, not only ward off dark beings, but must grab Helios' Sun Chariot to ride to the Underworld to end the madness and return the sun to it's proper place.

In the Underworld, the game really shines and the plot becomes more than just a fetch quest.  The subtle differences in the locales and enemies kept me plugging through when the game had gotten a bit repetitive above the surface.

Gameplay
The combat is action packed, with a variety of enemies, from small Harplings, to various medium sized Satyrs, to much bigger Death Knights.  That's not even including the bosses, who are quite cool, in their own right.  Kratos' Blades of Chaos really feel responsive and can do a couple of different attacks, based on the buttons pressed.  There is also a magical-type attack that Kratos uses, and all of his acquired weapons can be upgraded to more powerful versions.  The deaths of enemies are actually quite gratifying, whether with weapons or fists.

What would a God of War be without blood, and there is plenty to speak of here.  The game really earns its M rating (but probably more for a particular mini-game).  Some of the bigger enemies can be finished off with a Quick Time Event (QTE), which involves pressing the correct buttons within a certain time frame, while others can be grabbed and disposed of quickly.  I enjoyed the close-up fatality views (who doesn't love stabbing a cyclops in the eye) and thought they were well done,  but any that involved moving the analog nub in a certain direction, usually took a few tries to master correctly.  That was a big drawback for me.  I dreaded seeing the arrow, instead of a button to press, as I knew that it would most likely take me some time to do correctly, and the loss of precious health.

I also at first enjoyed the vagueness of some of the puzzles, as I tried to decipher them, but on a couple of occasions was completely stumped on what to do or where to go next.  Luckily, save points were strategically placed and if I did die exploring or mis-jumping, I didn't have to repeat much.  The prevalent use of ""invisible walls"" around cliff and in areas, usually led me to the right spot (but I still wish I could have thrown enemies off of cliffs).  Though, I sometimes tended to forget that Kratos could destroy pillars or walls to open up new areas.

The Underworld was my favorite section of the game, and especially thought that the representation of the Titans and Charon's boat was magnificent.  Additionally, the enemies not only become more difficult as the game progresses, but also a tad smarter.  If you do not time your jumps just right, the archers' aim follows you.  If you do not break shields, enemies use them wisely.  Random button mashing typically won't yield the results you're looking for.

The final battles were just what I'd hoped for.  The weapons I'd procured throughout the game were not useless, but necessary, and the Bosses were legendary, not just some overgrown guard or creature.  The plot also get a bit poignant at the end, which was a bit of a welcome surprise for me.

Graphics
Amazing for the PSP.  I almost went out and bought the PSP component AV cable, just to see this game bigger.  Both gameplay and cutscenes are engaging and you don't feel like you're combatting a bunch of pixels, there is quite a lot of detail for the tiny PSP screen.  Load times are virtually non-existent and the whole experience was very smooth and seamless.

Sound
Being that this is my first foray into God of War, I must say that Kratos' voice kind of bugged me.  I realize the guy is intense and extremely angry, but every word out of his mouth was way too dramatic for me.  I found it kind of cartoonish, instead of passionate.  The other character voices were much better and not so much over the top.  The background music blends well with each situation and adds to each scene instead of overpowering it.

Replay Value
The game is somewhat short, I finished in just over 8 hours on Hero (Normal) mode, but surprisingly didn't feel too short.  I probably wouldn't go back and play the game in one of the harder modes, but there are different costumes to unlock, as well as some Challenges of Hades levels to unlock more Treasures.  I'm definitely ready to move onto the God of War collection on my PS3.

5.0,False,"03 10, 2009",A3K91X9X2ARDOK,B001QD5JAQ,Terrence A.,"This is downloadable content done right. The story of Johnny K. and the rest of his biker compatriots is done so well that the claim that videogames may overtake movies in the arena of cinematic storytelling is given just that much more credibility. Compared to the cinematics of GTAIV, the cut scenes are a step up in quality on just about all counts. Facial expressions, voice acting... even the small nuances in an actor's performance make the story an engaging one, pulling you in right from the beginning moments.

The big difference between GTAIV and this expansion is that now you take on the role of Johnny Klebitz, a mad dog biker making his way up the ranks of The Lost MC (motorcycle club). The Lost MC are a colorful bunch and to detail these characters would ruin any kind of surprise that the game holds. Let's just say that you'll love who you're supposed to love and you'll despise the ones who deserve it. The story is action packed and dramatic, with great dialogue and great scenes between characters new and old. Even the missions here feel fresh, with some truly astounding mission sequences that really ratchet up the tension with loads of action packed violence. The best part is, the story fills in some unanswered blanks from Niko's time on the streets. You've met Johnny before, you probably just don't remember it.

Gameplay is just about the same with more of a focus on being a part of this family unit on wheels. You'll be spending most of your time on a motorcycle, as you'd expect. Some mechanics like the cell phone remain the same but suffice to say, when you call one of your ""brothers"", they'll be coming to help you either as weapon suppliers or straight backup. Even when you finish the story there will still be things for you to do: wiping out rival gangs, stealing vehicles for profit and in a tribute to the classic Road Rash games from years back, races where you wail on people with baseball bats. What more can you ask for?

A whole load of new tracks are seamlessly added to the in-game radio stations with 70's flavored rock understandably making up the bulk. The online modes are pretty sweet, with some new gameplay variations. Online play is definitely a blast, especially Witness Protection, a mode that pits players as either the cops or the motorcycle gang. The catch here is that the cops are charged with getting a bus with states witnesses on it from location to location before the motorcycle gang takes out the witnesses or the bus altogether. Mayhem is probably the best word to describe it.

If you liked GTAIV, this is a worthy purchase. The story is really well done and adds a sweet cap to the events that transpired in GTAIV. You get your money's worth and then some. This is a 5-star title all the way.

And this is only the first of two!",An even better story than Nico's? Is that possible?,1236643200,3,,
5.0,False,"08 3, 2016",A3LW6FZ12WUX2A,B0194M6C0G,4MaskCurse,"While I can't agree with one reviewer stating that the original Fairy Fencer F released on PS3 felt like a ""rushed, incomplete mess"", I will agree that this is indeed a step up from an already amazing game. Once again,the graphics are beautiful and the fairy transformation moves look amazing. The voice acting in English is well done and really adds a lot of humor and breaths specific traits in ach individual character. Speaking of characters two of my favorites in this game have to be Canadian accented Galdo  (A winner is us, hey?) And the voluptuous,fan service Harley (there's a lot of jiggle in those graphics) I also really enjoyed the soundtrack and am still kicking myself for not buying the bonus set which was released when the ps3 version was preordered. Out on a limb, does anyone out there know the name of the track to one of the games major bosses? All I can remember is that the boss was female and the music had a lot of intense violin which sounded incredible.

As for the differences between the ps4 and original ps3 release, you now have new storylines that branch off and give different endings. There is also the aspect of meeting certain characters at new times/under different circumstances as well as the gameplay mechanic no longer limiting your party to three people. New fairies can now be obtained which were unavailable in the original.

I really can't say enough good things about Fairy Fencer F Dark Advent. If there is any downside at all that might irritate some people, I would say that in the beginning there are quite a few of ""Eryn's Tutorials"" which can be a bit tiresome. However after the first couple hours or so these instances dwindle down and you can always view them again later in the help screen in case you are like me and sometimes lack patience. On a side note, Eryn looks pretty cute wearing librarian glasses!

In closing, I would recommend you pick up this title especially since JRPGs are getting harder and harder to find on the latest consoles. If we are lucky, maybe we will get a sequel or spin off.",Even better on PS4,1470182400,3,,

its got it all!

i've already played it all the way through, and my only 'complaints' are that it can be relatively short if you play it like i did, but otherwise has replay value becasue you can approach any situation in a multitude of ways. another would be that its still rather intensive resource wise (though runs about 1-3 fps faster than original crysis w/ same settings on my macbook pro [yes, im gaming on a macbook pro, not ideal for gaming, but its adequate]) and the ice levels really can be slow (15 fps, while most others i get 20-25fps; agian, not ideal gaming rig, so im sure custom builds will have no issue w/ SLI cards and quad cores in terms of performance)

let me make this clear: i am not a fan of highly restrictive DRM, but this game's securom #1 does not interfere with me in any way #2 allows me to play disk-less which i LOVE
i do see how installing securom can be invasive, so if any other complaint, i do suppose it would be that
ive heard it causes problems, but have seen none (perhaps because i do not use any disk image tools and have only one optical drive), so to EA: less favorable move, you should address this. i can see how it hurts the consumer

one misconception is the number of installs/ activations of the game, people think its like the game 'spore' meaning it limits total of 3 installs

wrong

it has a scheme similar to itunes, where: you can authorize up to 5 computers, and for each authorized computer, you have unlimited installs (though a new coputer auth. might be required when an OS is reinstalled, though i don't test this as  i do not reinstall vista every 2 weeks)

overall its a really really great game, and its really wrong for people to slam it with one star reviews when its DRM, though invasive and perhaps inappropriate, isn't all too bad, and they've never played it
i thoroughly enjoyed playing as the explosive sgt. sykes, and getting to find out what else happened on that island, with loads of great action and gameplay inbetween,

i'm more anti drm than pro, but still... i'm not going to let it ruin somthing great, especially when im an honest consumer paying full price, so have nothing to worry about really

case in point: ignore one star reviews; they never played the game, they are prejudging because of EA policies (which i agree are questioinable), but you need to experiance the awesomeness before getting so up in arms",Great Game!,1221696000,6,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

This game has it all...unique 3rd person, open world gameplay, amazing graphics, phenomenal art-style, incredible soundtrack, personality, humor...if this game was a woman, I would marry it.

First, the graphics/art style...You simply have to see this game in motion.  A quick search on YouTube and you will see what I'm talking about.  Some people have compared the art style to Saints Row, and there are definitely some similarities...but it would be Saints Row on steroids!
The colors just POP off the screen, and you can't help but be drawn to them.  I can't emphasize enough how SICK and tired I am of the same damn brown and gray color palettes used in so many modern shooters and even other genres.  Sunset Overdrive spits in the face of boring earth tones, and then punches you in the face with vibrant, pleasing colors.

Second, the soundtrack/audio...Again, the music will punch you in the face...repeatedly...but with an awesome, diverse Punk Rock soundtrack that I enjoyed so much, I went on Amazon Music and purchased the available MP3s.  I grew up in the 90's and listened to my fair share of Punk, and this game has re-awakened that taste in me.  I'm in my early 40's now, and there are some awesome songs on here that fit perfectly with the style  of this game, and are even great to listen to when driving, working...whatever...these songs will pump your day up.  The voice acting is great, funny, and again, perfectly fits the vibe of this game.

Gameplay...At first, when this game was announced, it really wasn't a blip on my radar (I also hadn't gotten an Xbox One, or even decided which system I was going to get), then closer to release, I started seeing and hearing more about this game, and I was really intrigued.
In fact, it is THIS game that is the reason I chose the Xbox One over PS4, and after playing this, I know I made the right decision.  No disrespect to PS4, I really considered that system for The Last of Us, Uncharted 4, and Infamous to name a few, but Sunset Overdrive is the total package for me.
It is so much fun grinding on rails, jumping, air-dashing and shooting OD mutants, and Scab Punks to such a phenomenal soundtrack, reactive soundtrack.  Also, I'm sure you've heard about the weapons...they are unique, fun, and have some amazing particle, and effects.  The TNT Teddy gun is powerful, and one of my personal favorites...especially against the Herkers.

Microsoft made a fantastic move betting on this game as an exclusive, and I really hope it pays off.  Insomniac really pulled out all the stops on this game, and it shows.
HIGHLY recommended if you are a gamer.
The first couple of hours, the mechanics definitely take some getting used to, but once you do, it's an absolute thrill ride you will remember for years to come.

The environments are spectacular and actually convey the intensity of the environments.  LIke several of other Tom Clancy's games, STEALTH is the operative word.  True, you do have some freedom in blasting away any moving thing. but the freedom is not to be utilised in every and any situation.  The details of Sam Fisher is absolutely fantastic, down to the circuit for his wetsuit.  I have yet to describe the environments.  In the first mission, Sam encounters a burning apartment complex, and exploring it is quite fantastic with the glows and embers of the fire flying every which way.  The patrols are much more realistic than in Metal Gear Solid, and they actually wear different suits and have different statures and facial features.
Now about Sam Fisher.  He does a split jump to keep above enemies, able to hang, zip, and dangle and has some of the coolest gear out there.  The fiber optic camera for use beneath doors is awesome. He has the abillity to interrogate captured persons and utilise them as body shields when necessary.  Also, the voiceover for Sam Fisher  is great.
My one and only criticism regarding the game is that Sam should have a first-person view for much better head-shots, particularly in intense situations.

5.0,False,"10 15, 2003",AZNCDOLHNG9GO,B00005BW7Q,S. Gates,"Fans of Xenogears who have been waiting for five years for this will almost certainly not be disappointed.  While many things have been given an overhaul (the battle system and the character development being the most major), it still feels like good ol' Xenogears.  For the new player, there's enough for it to stand on its own just fine, but for a Xeno fan, it's fun spotting all the things that come into play later.
The gameplay is almost perfect, the only downside being the steep learning curve.  It took me some time to figure out how to effectively distribute my tech points, use the boost system, etc., and the A.G.W.S. things I still never got the hang of.  They were far too expensive to keep up and nowhere near as useful as Gears.
The characters and the story are all well-developed and rivetting.  Each character has his or her own demons which they must deal with, and I think that each character is very sympathetic.
Overall, this is a must for any RPG fan and a good edition to the Xeno series.  Square was insane for letting this team go.",A few problems but still incredible.,1066176000,5,,
